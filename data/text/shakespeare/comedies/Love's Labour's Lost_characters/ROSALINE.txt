	Another of these students at that time
	Was there with him, if I have heard a truth:
	Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
	Within the limit of becoming mirth,
	I never spent an hour's talk withal.
	His eye begets occasion for his wit;
	For every object that the one doth catch
	The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
	Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
	Delivers in such apt and gracious words,
	That aged ears play truant at his tales,
	And younger hearings are quite ravished;
	So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

<ROSALINE>	<21%>
	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ROSALINE>	<21%>
	How needless was it then

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>

	Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><65%>
<ROSALINE>	<66%>
	That was the way to make his godhead wax;

	You'll ne'er be friends with him: a' kill'd your sister.

	What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><65%>
<ROSALINE>	<66%>
	We need more light to find your meaning out.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><65%>
<ROSALINE>	<67%>
	Look, what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 2><65%>
<ROSALINE>	<67%>
	Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>

	Great reason; for, 'past cure is still past care.'

	I would you knew:
	An if my face were but as fair as yours,
	My favour were as great; be witness this.
	Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne:
	The numbers true; and, were the numb'ring too,
	I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
	I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.
	O! he hath drawn my picture in his letter.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
<ROSALINE>	<67%>
	Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>
<ROSALINE>	<67%>
	'Ware pencils! how? let me not die your debtor.
	My red dominical, my golden letter:

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
<ROSALINE>	<68%>
	They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
	That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go.
	O that I knew he were but in by the week!
	How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,
	And wait the season, and observe the times,
	And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rimes,
	And shape his service wholly to my hests,
	And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
	So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
	That he should be my fool, and I his fate.

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 2><70%>

	But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
<ROSALINE>	<72%>
	What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
	If they do speak our language, 'tis our will

	Know what they would.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
<ROSALINE>	<72%>
	What would they, say they?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
<ROSALINE>	<72%>
	Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><71%>
<ROSALINE>	<73%>
	It is not so. Ask them how many inches
	Is in one mile: if they have measur'd many,
	The measure then of one is easily told.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
<ROSALINE>	<73%>
	How many weary steps,
	Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
	Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
<ROSALINE>	<73%>
	My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
<ROSALINE>	<73%>
	O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
	Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
<STAGE DIR>
<Music plays.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Not yet! no dance! thus change I like the moon.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 2><72%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	You took the moon at full, but now she's chang'd.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Our ears vouchsafe it.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
	We'll not be nice: take hands: we will not dance.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Only to part friends.
	Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	We can afford no more at such a price.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Your absence only.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
	Twice to your visor, and half once to you!
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 2><73%>
<ROSALINE>	<74%>
	In private, then.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
<ROSALINE>	<76%>
	Not one word more, my maids: break off, break off.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
<ROSALINE>	<76%>
	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 2><75%>
<ROSALINE>	<76%>
	O! they were all in lamentable cases.
	The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 2><76%>
<ROSALINE>	<77%>
	Well, better wits have worn plain statutecaps.
	But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 2><77%>
<ROSALINE>	<77%>
	Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
	Let's mock them still, as well known as disguis'd.
	Let us complain to them what fools were here,
	Disguis'd like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
	And wonder what they were, and to what end
	Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd,
	And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
	Should be presented at our tent to us.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 2><79%>
<ROSALINE>	<80%>
	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
	My lady, to the manner of the days,
	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
	We four, indeed, confronted were with four
	In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
	And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
	They did not bless us with one happy word.
	I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
	When they are thirsty, fools would fam have drink.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<80%>
	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye—
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<81%>
	But that you take what doth to you belong,
	It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<81%>
	All the fool mine?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<81%>
	Which of the visors was it that you wore?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<81%>
	There, then, that visor; that superfluous case
	That hid the worse, and show'd the better face.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 2><80%>
<ROSALINE>	<81%>
	Help! hold his brows! he'll swound.
	Why look you pale?
	Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 2><81%>
<ROSALINE>	<82%>
	Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 2><81%>
<ROSALINE>	<82%>
	It is not so. For how can this be true,
	That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 2><81%>
<ROSALINE>	<82%>
	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<ROSALINE>	<83%>
	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
	As precious eyesight, and did value me
	Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,
	That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<ROSALINE>	<83%>
	By heaven you did; and to confirm it plain,
	You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<ROSALINE>	<95%>
	We did not quote them so.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<ROSALINE>	<96%>
	You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd:
	You are attaint with faults and perjury;
	Therefore, if you my favour mean to get,
	A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
	But seek the weary beds of people sick.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<ROSALINE>	<97%>
	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
	Before I saw you, and the world's large tongue
	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks;
	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
	Which you on all estates will execute
	That lie within the mercy of your wit:
	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
	And therewithal to win me, if you please,—
	Without the which I am not to be won,—
	You shall this twelvemonth term, from day to day,
	Visit the speechless sick, and still converse
	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
	With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
</ROSALINE>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<ROSALINE>	<98%>
	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
	A jest's prosperity lics in the ear
	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
	Will hear your idle scorns, continue them,
	And I will have you and that fault withal;
	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
	And I shall find you empty of that fault,
	Right joyful of your reformation.
</ROSALINE>
