	I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy: what great men have been in love?

	Of what complexion?

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<ARMADO>	<13%>
	Is that one of the four complexions?
</ARMADO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<ARMADO>	<13%>
	Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>

<ARMADO>	<16%>
	I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn,—which is a great argument of falsehood,—if I love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil: there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second clause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not: his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is, to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust, rapier! be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me some extemporal god of rime, for I am sure I shall turn sonneter. Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

	Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass: I do beseech thee, remember thy curtsy; I beseech thee, apparel thy head: and among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his Grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio: but, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world: but let that pass. The very all of all is, but, sweet heart, I do implore secrecy, that the king would have me present the princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antick, or fire-work. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance.

	I

	When daisies pied and violets blue
	And lady-smocks all silver-white
	And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
	Do paint the meadows with delight,
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
	Cuckoo,
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O, word of fear,
	Unpleasing to a married ear!

	II.

	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
	And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
	When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
	And maidens bleach their summer smocks,
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
	Cuckoo;
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O, word of fear,
	Unpleasing to a married ear!

	WINTER.


	III.

	When icicles hang by the wall,
	And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
	And Tom bears logs into the hall,
	And milk comes frozen home in pail,
	When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
	Then nightly sings the staring owl,
	Tu-who;
	Tu-whit, tu-who—a merry note,
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

	IV

	When all aloud the wind doth blow,
	And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
	And birds sit brooding in the snow,
	And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
	When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
	Then nightly sings the staring owl,
	Tu-who;
	Tu-whit, tu-who—a merry note,
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
