	I know him, madam: at a marriage feast,
	Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
	Of Jacques Falconbridge, solemnized
	In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
	A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
	Well fitted in the arts, glorious in arms:
	Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
	The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,—
	If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,—
	Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will;
	Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
	It should none spare that come within his power.

	They say so most that most his humours know.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<MARIA>	<24%>
	That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord:
	Not a word with him but a jest.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<MARIA>	<25%>
	Two hot sheeps, marry!
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<MARIA>	<25%>
	You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<MARIA>	<25%>
	Not so, gentle beast.
	My lips are no common, though several they be.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>

	To my fortunes and me.

	He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>

	No.

	You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><38%>
<MARIA>	<39%>
	A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><38%>
<MARIA>	<39%>
	Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith your hand is out.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><38%>

	Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 2><66%>

	This, and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
	The letter is too long by half a mile.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
<MARIA>	<68%>
	Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 2><67%>
<MARIA>	<68%>
	Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
	As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
	Since all the power thereof it doth apply
	To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

</MARIA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>
<MARIA>	<75%>
	Name it.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><74%>

	Say you so? Fair lord,
	Take that for your fair lady.

	Dumaine was at my service, and his sword:
	'No point,' quoth I: my servant straight was mute.

	Dumaine is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

	God save you, madam!
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<MARIA>	<93%>
	I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
	Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father—
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<MARIA>	<93%>
	Even so: my tale is told.
</MARIA>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>

	At the twelvemonth's end
	I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

	The liker you; few taller are so young.
