	I will something affect the letter; for it argues facility.

	The preyful princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing pricket;
	Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made sore with shooting.
	The dogs did yell; put l to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket;
	Or pricket, sore, or else sorel; the people fall a hooting.
	If sore be sore, then l to sore makes fifty sores one sorel!
	Of one sore I a hundred make, by adding but one more l.

Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet;    deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King; it may concern much. Stay not thy compliment; I forgive thy duty. Adieu.
