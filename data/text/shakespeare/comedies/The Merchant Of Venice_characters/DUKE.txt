<SPEECH 1><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<DUKE>	<70%>
	What, is Antonio here?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<DUKE>	<70%>
	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
	Uncapable of pity, void and empty
	From any dram of mercy.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<DUKE>	<71%>
	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<DUKE>	<71%>
	Make room, and let him stand before our face.
	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
	That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
	Than is thy strange-apparent cruelty;
	And where thou now exact'st the penalty,—
	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,—
	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
	But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
	Forgive a moiety of the principal;
	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
	That have of late so huddled on his back,
	Enow to press a royal merchant down,
	And pluck commiseration of his state
	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
	To offices of tender courtesy.
	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
<DUKE>	<73%>
	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
<DUKE>	<74%>
	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
	Whom I have sent for to determine this,
	Come here to-day.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
<DUKE>	<74%>
	Bring us the letters: call the messenger.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><73%>
<DUKE>	<74%>
	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
<DUKE>	<75%>
	This letter from Bellario doth commend
	A young and learned doctor to our court.
	Where is he?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><74%>
<DUKE>	<76%>
	With all my heart: some three or four of you
	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
	Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
<DUKE>	<76%>
	You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

</DUKE>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
<DUKE>	<76%>
	You are welcome: take your place.
	Are you acquainted with the difference
	That holds this present question in the court?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><75%>
<DUKE>	<77%>
	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><83%>
<DUKE>	<84%>
	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
	The other half comes to the general state,
	Which humbleness may drive into a fine.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
<DUKE>	<85%>
	He shall do this, or else I do recant
	The pardon that I late pronounced here.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
<DUKE>	<85%>
	Get thee gone, but do it.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
<DUKE>	<85%>
	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><84%>
<DUKE>	<85%>
	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
</DUKE>
