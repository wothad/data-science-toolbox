	Madam, there is alighted at your gate
	A young Venetian, one that comes before
	To signify the approaching of his lord;
	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
	To wit, — besides commends and courteous breath,—
	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
	So likely an embassador of love.
	A day in April never came so sweet,
	To show how costly summer was at hand,
	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
</SERVANT>
