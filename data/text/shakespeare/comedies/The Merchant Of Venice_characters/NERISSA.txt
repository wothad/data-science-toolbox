	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.

	Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<NERISSA>	<9%>
	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>

	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should refuse to accept him.
</NERISSA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<NERISSA>	<11%>
	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords: they have acquainted me with their determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition depending on the caskets.
</NERISSA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<NERISSA>	<11%>
	Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in the company of the Marquis of Montferrat?

<NERISSA>	<12%>
	True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.

	My lord and lady, it is now our time,

	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 2><87%>
<NERISSA>	<88%>
	Sir, I would speak with you.
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Portia.>
</STAGE DIR> I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,

	What talk you of the posy, or the value?
	You swore to me, when I did give it you,
	That you would wear it till your hour of death,
	And that it should lie with you in your grave:
	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
	You should have been respective and have kept it.
	Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
	The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
</NERISSA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
<NERISSA>	<98%>
	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
	In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

<NERISSA>	<99%>
	Ay; but the clerk that never means to do it,
