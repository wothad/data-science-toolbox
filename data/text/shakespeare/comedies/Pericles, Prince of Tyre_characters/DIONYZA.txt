	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
	For who digs hills because they do aspire
	Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
	O my distressed lord! even such our griefs are;
	Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
	But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

	I'll do my best, sir.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><16%>
<DIONYZA>	<18%>
	O! 'tis too true,
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><17%>
<DIONYZA>	<18%>
	Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<DIONYZA>	<55%>
	O your sweet queen!
	That the strict fates had pleas'd you had brought her hither,
	To have bless'd mine eyes with her!
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<DIONYZA>	<56%>
	I have one myself,
	Who shall not be more dear to my respect
	Than yours, my lord.

	Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do 't:
	'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
	Thou canst not do a thing i' the world so soon,
	To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
	Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
	Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
	Even women have cast off, melt thee, but he
	A soldier to thy purpose.

	The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
	She comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
	Thou art resolv'd?
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIONYZA>	<60%>
	How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
	How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
	Consume your blood with sorrowing; you have
	A nurse of me. Lord! how your favour's chang'd
	With this unprofitable woe. Come,
	Give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
	Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
	And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
	Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIONYZA>	<60%>
	Come, come;
	I love the king your father, and yourself,
	With more than foreign heart. We every day
	Expect him here; when he shall come and find
	Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
	He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
	Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
	No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you;
	Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
	That excellent complexion, which did steal
	The eyes of young and old. Care not for me;
	I can go home alone.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<DIONYZA>	<61%>
	Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
	Walk half an hour, Leonine, at least.
	Remember what I have said.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<DIONYZA>	<61%>
	I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while;
	Pray you walk softly, do not heat your blood:
	What! I must have care of you.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	I think
	You'll turn a child again.

<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
	Unless you play the pious innocent,
	And for an honest attribute cry out
	'She died by foul play.'
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><69%>
<DIONYZA>	<70%>
	Be one of those that think
	The pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
	To think of what a noble strain you are,
	And of how coward a spirit.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<DIONYZA>	<71%>
	Be it so, then;
	Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
	She did distain my child, and stood between
	Her and her fortunes; none would look on her,
	But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
	Not worth the time of day. It pierc'd me thorough;
	And though you call my course unnatural,
	You not your child well loving, yet I find
	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
	Perform'd to your sole daughter.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<DIONYZA>	<71%>
	And as for Pericles,
	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
	And even yet we mourn; her monument
	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
	In glittering golden characters express
	A general praise to her, and care in us
	At whose expense 'tis done.
</DIONYZA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<DIONYZA>	<71%>
	You are like one that superstitiously
	Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies;
	But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
