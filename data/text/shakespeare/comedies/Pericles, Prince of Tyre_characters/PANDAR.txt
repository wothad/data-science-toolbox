	Search the market narrowly; Mitylene is full of gallants; we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.

	Therefore, let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.

	Thou sayst true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.

	Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.

	Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her entertainment.

	Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come here.

	Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
