<THAISA>	<30%>
	It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
	My commendations great, whose merit's less.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<THAISA>	<30%>
	Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.

</THAISA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<THAISA>	<30%>
	A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
	And the device he bears upon his shield
	Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun;
	The word, Lux tua vita mihi.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<THAISA>	<31%>
	A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
	And the device he bears upon his shield
	Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
	The motto thus, in Spanish, Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<THAISA>	<31%>
	The third of Antioch;
	And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
	The word, Me pompæ provexit apex.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<THAISA>	<31%>
	A burning torch that's turned upside down;
	The word, Quod me alit me extinguit.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<THAISA>	<31%>
	The fifth, a hand environed with clouds,
	Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
	The motto thus, Sic spectanda fides.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<THAISA>	<32%>
	He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
	A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
	The motto, In hac spe vivo.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<THAISA>	<33%>
	But you, my knight and guest;
	To whom this wreath of victory I give,
	And crown you king of this day's happiness.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<THAISA>	<34%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
	All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury,
	Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<THAISA>	<34%>
	To me he seems like diamond to glass.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<THAISA>	<35%>
	What is it
	To me, my father?
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<THAISA>	<35%>
	Alas! my father, it befits not me
	Unto a stranger knight to be so bold;
	He may my proffer take for an offence,
	Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<THAISA>	<35%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<THAISA>	<36%>
	The king, my father, sir, has drunk to you.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<THAISA>	<36%>
	Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<THAISA>	<36%>
	And further he desires to know of you,
	Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<THAISA>	<36%>
	He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,
	A gentleman of Tyre,
	Who only by misfortune of the seas
	Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 5><42%>
<THAISA>	<43%>
	Why, sir, say if you had,
	Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 5><43%>
<THAISA>	<44%>
	Yes, if you love me, sir.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 5><43%>
<THAISA>	<44%>
	Yes, if 't please your majesty.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<THAISA>	<54%>
	O dear Diana!
	Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<THAISA>	<57%>
	It is my lord's.
	That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
	Even on my eaning time; but whether there
	Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
	I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
	My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
	A vestal livery will I take me to,
	And never more have joy.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<THAISA>	<57%>
	My recompense is thanks, that's all;
	Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
</STAGE DIR>

</THAISA>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<THAISA>	<96%>
	Voice and favour!
	You are, you are—O royal Pericles!—
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<THAISA>	<97%>
	O! let me look!
	If he be none of mine, my sanctity
	Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
	But curb it, spite of seeing. O! my lord,
	Are you not Pericles? Like him you speak,
	Like him you are. Did you not name a tempest,
	A birth, and death?
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<THAISA>	<97%>
	That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
	And drown'd.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<THAISA>	<97%>
	Now I know you better.
	When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
	The king my father gave you such a ring.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<THAISA>	<98%>
	Bless'd, and mine own!
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<THAISA>	<98%>
	I know you not.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<THAISA>	<98%>
	'Twas Helicanus then.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<THAISA>	<98%>
	Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
	Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
	From first to last resolve you.
</THAISA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<THAISA>	<99%>
	Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
	My father's dead.
</THAISA>
