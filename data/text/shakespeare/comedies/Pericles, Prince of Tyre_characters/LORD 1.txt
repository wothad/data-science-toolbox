	They are, my liege;
	And stay your coming to present themselves.

	He had need mean better than his outward show
	Can any way speak in his just commend;
	For, by his rusty outside he appears
	To have practis'd more the whipstock than the lance.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 1>	<38%>
	See, not a man in private conference
	Or council has respect with him but he.

	Follow me then. Lord Helicane, a word.

<LORD 1>	<39%>
	Wrong not yourself then, noble Helicane;
	But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
	Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
	If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
	If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;
	And be resolv'd he lives to govern us,
	Or dead, give 's cause to mourn his funeral,
	And leaves us to our free election.
</LORD 1>

	To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
	And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
	We with our travels will endeavour it.

	Sir,
	We have a maid in Mitylene, I durst wager,
	Would win some words of him.
</LORD 1>
