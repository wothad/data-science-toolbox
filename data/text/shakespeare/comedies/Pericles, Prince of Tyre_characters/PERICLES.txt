	Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
	I'll make my will then; and as sick men do,
	Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,
	Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did:
	So I bequeath a happy peace to you
	And all good men, as every prince should do;

	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,

	I am no viper, yet I feed

	I found that kindness in a father.
	He's father, son, and husband mild,
	I mother, wife, and yet his child.
	How they may be, and yet in two,
	As you will live, resolve it you.

	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers!
	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
	Fair glass of light, I lov'd you, and could still,
	Were not this glorious casket stor'd with ill:
	But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;
	For he's no man on whom perfections wait
	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
	You're a fair viol, and your sense the strings,
	Who, finger'd to make men his lawful music,
	Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken;

	Great king,
	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown;
	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,
	Blows dust in others' eyes, to spread itself;
	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for 't.
	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
	It is enough you know; and it is fit,
	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
	All love the womb that their first being bred,
	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.

	How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
	When what is done is like a hypocrite,
	The which is good in nothing but in sight!
	If it be true that I interpret false,
	Then were it certain you were not so bad
	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
	Where now you're both a father and a son,
	By your untimely claspings with your child,—
	Which pleasure fits a husband, not a father;—
	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
	By the defiling of her parent's bed;
	And both like serpents are, who though they feed
	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
	Then, lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear,
	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

<To those without.>
</STAGE DIR> Let none disturb us.—
	Why should this change of thoughts,
	The sad companion, dull-ey'd melancholy,
	Be my so us'd a guest, as not an hour
	In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night—
	The tomb where grief should sleep—can breed me quiet?
	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
	And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,
	Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here;
	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
	That have their first conception by mis-dread,
	Have after-nourishment and life by care;
	And what was first but fear what might be done,
	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
	And so with me: the great Antiochus,—
	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
	Since he's so great can make his will his act,—
	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
	Nor boots it me to say I honour him,
	If he suspect I may dishonour him;
	And what may make him blush in being known,
	He'll stop the course by which it might be known.
	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
	Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
	Which care of them, not pity of myself,—
	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,—
	Make both my body pine and soul to languish,
	And punish that before that he would punish.

	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
	That minister'st a potion unto me
	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
	Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death
	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
	From whence an issue I might propagate
	Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
	The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest;
	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth; but thou know'st this,
	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
	Which fear so grew in me I hither fled,
	Under the covering of a careful night,
	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years.
	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
	That I should open to the listening air
	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
	To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him;
	When all, for mine, if I may call 't, offence,
	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
	Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
	Who now reprov'st me for it,—

<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<PERICLES>	<49%>
	A terrible child-bed hast thou had, my dear;
	No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
	Forgot thee utterly; nor have I time
	To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
	Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
	Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
	And aye-remaining lamps, the belching whale
	And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
	Lying with simple shells! O Lychorida!
	Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
	My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
	Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
	Upon the pillow. Hie thee, whiles I say
	A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<PERICLES>	<49%>
	I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<PERICLES>	<49%>
	Thither, gentle mariner,
	Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<PERICLES>	<50%>
	O! make for Tarsus.
	There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
	Cannot hold out to Tyrus; there I'll leave it
	At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner;
	I'll bring the body presently.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<PERICLES>	<55%>
	Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;
	My twelve months are expir'd, and Tyrus stands
	In a litigious peace. You and your lady

	Make up the rest upon you!
</PERICLES>

<PERICLES>	<55%>
	We cannot but obey

	For she was born at sea, I have nam'd so—here
	I charge your charity withal, and leave her
	The infant of your care, beseeching you
	To give her princely training, that she may be
	Manner'd as she is born.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<PERICLES>	<56%>
	I believe you;
	Your honour and your goodness teach me to 't,
	Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
	By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
	Unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain,
	Though I show ill in 't. So I take my leave.
	Good madam, make me blessed in your care
	In bringing up my child.

	My fortunes—parentage—good parentage—

</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<PERICLES>	<88%>
	I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.

	Here of these shores?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<PERICLES>	<88%>
	I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
	My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
	Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
	As silver-voic'd; her eyes as jewel-like,
	And cas'd as richly; in pace another Juno;
	Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
	The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Where were you bred?
	And how achiev'd you these endowments, which
	You make more rich to owe?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Prithee, speak;
	Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look'st
	Modest as justice, and thou seem'st a palace
	For the crown'd truth to dwell in. I believe thee,
	And make my senses credit thy relation
	To points that seem impossible; for thou lookest
	Like one I lov'd indeed. What were thy friends?
	Didst thou not say when I did push thee back,—
	Which was when I perceiv'd thee,—that thou cam'st
	From good descending?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst
	Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
	And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
	If both were open'd.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<PERICLES>	<89%>
	Tell thy story;
	If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
	Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
	Have suffer'd like a girl; yet thou dost look
	Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
	Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
	How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
	Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<PERICLES>	<90%>
	O! I am mock'd,
	And thou by some incensed god sent hither
	To make the world to laugh at me.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<PERICLES>	<90%>
	Nay, I'll be patient.
	Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
	To call thyself Marina.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<PERICLES>	<90%>
	How! a king's daughter?
	And call'd Marina?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<PERICLES>	<90%>
	But are you flesh and blood?
	Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
	Motion!—Well; speak on. Where were you born?
	And wherefore call'd Marina?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<PERICLES>	<90%>
	At sea! what mother?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<PERICLES>	<91%>
	O! stop there a little.
	This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
	Did mock sad fools withal; this cannot be.
	My daughter's buried. Well; where were you bred?
	I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
	And never interrupt you.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<PERICLES>	<91%>
	I will believe you by the syllable

	Ho, Helicanus!
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<PERICLES>	<91%>
	Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
	Most wise in general; tell me, if thou canst,
	What this maid is, or what is like to be,
	That thus hath made me weep?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<PERICLES>	<92%>
	O Helicanus! strike me, honour'd sir;
	Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
	Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
	O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
	And drown me with their sweetness. O! come hither,
	Thou that begett'st him that did thee beget;
	Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
	And found at sea again. O Helicanus!
	Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
	As thunder threatens us; this is Marina.
	What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
	For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
	Though doubts did ever sleep.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 99><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<PERICLES>	<92%>
	I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
	My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said

</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<PERICLES>	<93%>
	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child,
	Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
	She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
	By savage Cleon; she shall tell thee all;
	When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
	She is thy very princess. Who is this?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<PERICLES>	<93%>
	I embrace you.
	Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
	O heavens! bless my girl. But, hark! what music?
	Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
	O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
	How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<PERICLES>	<93%>
	None!
	The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<PERICLES>	<93%>
	Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<PERICLES>	<93%>
	Most heavenly music:
	It nips me unto list'ning, and thick slumber

</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>

	Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,

	My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike

</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
<PERICLES>	<96%>
	Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
	I here confess myself the King of Tyre;
	Who, frighted from my country, did wed
	At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
	At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
	A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess!
	Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
	Was nurs'd with Cleon, whom at fourteen years
	He sought to murder; but her better stars
	Brought her to Mitylene, 'gainst whose shore
	Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
	Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
	Made known herself my daughter.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PERICLES>	<96%>
	What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PERICLES>	<96%>
	Reverend appearer, no;
	I threw her o'erboard with these very arms.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PERICLES>	<97%>
	'Tis most certain.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PERICLES>	<97%>
	May we see them?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PERICLES>	<97%>
	The voice of dead Thaisa!
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PERICLES>	<97%>
	Immortal Dian!
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PERICLES>	<97%>
	This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
	Makes my past miseries sport: you shall do well,
	That on the touching of her lips I may
	Melt and no more be seen. O! come, be buried
	A second time within these arms.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PERICLES>	<98%>
	Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
	Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina,
	For she was yielded there.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PERICLES>	<98%>
	You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
	I left behind an ancient substitute;
	Can you remember what I call'd the man?
	I have nam'd him oft.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<PERICLES>	<98%>
	Still confirmation!
	Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
	Now do I long to hear how you were found,
	How possibly preserv'd, and whom to thank,
	Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<PERICLES>	<98%>
	Reverend sir,
	The gods can have no mortal officer
	More like a god than you. Will you deliver
	How this dead queen re-lives?
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<PERICLES>	<99%>
	Pure Dian! bless thee for thy vision; I
	Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
	This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
	Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now
	This ornament
	Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
	And what this fourteen years no rasor touch'd,
	To grace thy marriage-day I'll beautify.
</PERICLES>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<PERICLES>	<99%>
	Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
	We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
	Will in that kingdom spend our following days;
	Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
	Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
	To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead's the way.

<Enter Gower.>
</STAGE DIR>
	In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
	Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
	In Pericles, his queen, and daughter, seen—
	Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen—
	Virtue preserv'd from fell destruction's blast,
	Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last.
	In Helicanus may you well descry
	A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.
	In reverend Cerimon there well appears
	The worth that learned charity aye wears.
	For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
	Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
	Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
	That him and his they in his palace burn:
	The gods for murder seemed so content
	To punish them; although not done, but meant.
	So on your patience evermore attending,
	New joy wait on you! Here our play hath ending.
