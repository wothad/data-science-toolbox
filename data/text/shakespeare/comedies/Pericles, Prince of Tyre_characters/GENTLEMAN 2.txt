<GENTLEMAN 2>	<50%>
	Good morrow to your lordship.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<51%>
	That is the cause we trouble you so early;
	'Tis not our husbandry.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
	Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
	Your creatures, who by you have been restor'd:
	And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
	Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
	Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.

</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	'Tis like a coffin, sir.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	'Tis so, my lord.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<52%>
	A delicate odour.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<53%>
	Most likely, sir.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<54%>
	Is not this strange?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<74%>
	No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<74%>
	No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses. Shall's go hear the vestals sing?
</GENTLEMAN 2>
