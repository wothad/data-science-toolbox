	Philemon, ho!

</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<CERIMON>	<50%>
	Get fire and meat for these poor men;
	'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<CERIMON>	<50%>
	Your master will be dead ere you return;
	There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
	That can recover him. <STAGE DIR>
<To Philemon.>
</STAGE DIR> Give this to the 'pothecary,
	And tell me how it works.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt all except Cerimon.>
</STAGE DIR>

</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<CERIMON>	<50%>
	Gentlemen,
	Why do you stir so early?
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<CERIMON>	<51%>
	O! you say well.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<CERIMON>	<51%>
	I hold it ever,
	Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
	Than nobleness and riches; careless heirs
	May the two latter darken and expend,
	But immortality attends the former,
	Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever
	Have studied physic, through which secret art,
	By turning o'er authorities, I have—
	Together with my practice—made familiar
	To me and to my aid the blest infusions
	That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
	And can speak of the disturbances
	That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
	A more content in course of true delight
	Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
	Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
	To please the fool and death.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CERIMON>	<52%>
	What is that?
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CERIMON>	<52%>
	Set it down; let's look upon 't.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CERIMON>	<52%>
	Whate'er it be,
	'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight;
	If the sea's stomach be o'ercharg'd with gold,
	'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CERIMON>	<52%>
	How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
	Did the sea cast it up?
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CERIMON>	<52%>
	Come, wrench it open.
	Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<CERIMON>	<53%>
	As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
	O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<CERIMON>	<53%>
	Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasur'd
	With full bags of spices! A passport too!
	Apollo, perfect me i' the characters!

	Here I give to understand,
	If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
	I, King Pericles, have lost
	This queen worth all our mundane cost.
	Who finds her, give her burying;
	She was the daughter of a king:
	Besides this treasure for a fee,
	The gods requite his charity!

	If thou liv'st, Pericles, thou hast a heart
	That even cracks for woe! This chanc'd to-night.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<CERIMON>	<53%>
	Nay, certainly to-night;
	For look, how fresh she looks. They were too rough
	That threw her in the sea. Make fire within;
	Fetch hither all the boxes in my closet.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Second Servant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Death may usurp on nature many hours,
	And yet the fire of life kindle again
	The overpress'd spirits. I heard
	Of an Egyptian, that had nine hours lien dead,
	Who was by good appliances recovered.

<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
	The rough and woeful music that we have,
	Cause it to sound, beseech you.
	The viol once more;—how thou stirr'st, thou block!
	The music there! I pray you, give her air.
	Gentlemen,
	This queen will live; nature awakes, a warmth
	Breathes out of her; she hath not been entranc'd
	Above five hours. See! how she 'gins to blow
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<CERIMON>	<54%>
	She is alive! behold,
	Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
	Which Pericles hath lost,
	Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
	The diamonds of a most praised water
	Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
	And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
	Rare as you seem to be!
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<CERIMON>	<54%>
	Hush, gentle neighbours!
	Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
	Get linen; now this matter must be look'd to,
	For her relapse is mortal, Come, come;
	And Æsculapius guide us!
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<CERIMON>	<57%>
	Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
	Lay with you in your coffer; which are now
	At your command. Know you the character?
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<CERIMON>	<57%>
	Madam, if this you purpose as you speak,
	Diana's temple is not distant far,
	Where you may abide till your date expire.
	Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
	Shall there attend you.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<CERIMON>	<96%>
	Noble sir,
	If you have told Diana's altar true,
	This is your wife.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Upon this coast, I warrant you.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Look to the lady. O! she's but o'erjoy'd.
	Early in blustering morn this lady was
	Thrown upon this shore. I op'd the coffin,
	Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and plac'd her
	Here in Diana's temple.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<CERIMON>	<97%>
	Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
	Whither I invite you. Look! Thaisa is
	Recovered.
</CERIMON>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<CERIMON>	<98%>
	I will, my lord.
	Beseech you, first go with me to my house.
	Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
	How she came placed here in the temple;
	No needful thing omitted.
</CERIMON>
