<SPEECH 1><ACT 4><SCENE 2><62%>
<BOULT>	<63%>
	Sir?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<BOULT>	<64%>
	Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the market?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<BOULT>	<64%>
	Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I'll go search the market.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<BOULT>	<65%>
	Come your ways. My masters, you say she's a virgin?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<BOULT>	<65%>
	Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<BOULT>	<65%>
	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes; there's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<BOULT>	<65%>
	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
<BOULT>	<66%>
	Performance shall follow.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BOULT>	<67%>
	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BOULT>	<67%>
	Faith, they listened to me, as they would have hearkened to their father's testament. There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BOULT>	<67%>
	To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i' the hams?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
<BOULT>	<68%>
	Ay; he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
<BOULT>	<68%>
	Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
<BOULT>	<68%>
	O! take her home, mistress, take her home; these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BOULT>	<69%>
	Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint,—
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BOULT>	<69%>
	I may so?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BOULT>	<69%>
	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BOULT>	<69%>
	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
<BOULT>	<75%>
	Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make all our swearers priests.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
<BOULT>	<75%>
	We should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.

</BOULT>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
<BOULT>	<75%>
	I am glad to see your honour in good health.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
<BOULT>	<76%>
	For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she were a rose indeed if she had but—
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
<BOULT>	<76%>
	O! sir, I can be modest.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<BOULT>	<79%>
	I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<BOULT>	<79%>
	How's this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel. Come your ways.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<BOULT>	<80%>
	I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.

</BOULT>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<BOULT>	<80%>
	Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<BOULT>	<80%>
	She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<BOULT>	<80%>
	The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<BOULT>	<80%>
	An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall be ploughed.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<BOULT>	<81%>
	Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<BOULT>	<81%>
	To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<BOULT>	<81%>
	Come now, your one thing.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<BOULT>	<81%>
	Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<BOULT>	<81%>
	What would you have me do? go to the wars, would you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
<BOULT>	<82%>
	But can you teach all this you speak of?
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
<BOULT>	<82%>
	Well, I will see what I can do for thee; if I can place thee, I will.
</BOULT>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
<BOULT>	<82%>
	Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master and mistress have bought you, there's no going but by their consent; therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come; I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.

<Exeunt.>
