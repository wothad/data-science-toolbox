<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Who is that calls so coldly?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<CURTIS>	<60%>
	Away, you three-inch-fool! I am no beast.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	Come, you are so full of cony-catching.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	How?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<61%>
	Let's ha't, good Grumio.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<62%>
	Here.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<62%>
	This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<62%>
	Both of one horse?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<CURTIS>	<62%>
	Why, a horse.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
<CURTIS>	<62%>
	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
<CURTIS>	<63%>
	They are.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
<CURTIS>	<63%>
	Do you hear? ho! you must meet my master to countenance my mistress.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><61%>
<CURTIS>	<63%>
	Who knows not that?
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
<CURTIS>	<63%>
	I call them forth to credit her.
</CURTIS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<CURTIS>	<66%>
	In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
	And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
	Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
	And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
	Away, away! for he is coming hither.
