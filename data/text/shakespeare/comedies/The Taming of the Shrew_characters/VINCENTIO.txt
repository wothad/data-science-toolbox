<VINCENTIO>	<85%>
	Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
	That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
	My name is called Vincentio; my dwelling, Pisa;
	And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
	A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 5><84%>
<VINCENTIO>	<86%>
	Lucentio, gentle sir.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 5><85%>
<VINCENTIO>	<86%>
	But is this true? or is it else your pleasure,
	Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
	Upon the company you overtake?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<VINCENTIO>	<87%>
	You shall not choose but drink before you go.
	I think I shall command your welcome here,
	And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<VINCENTIO>	<87%>
	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<VINCENTIO>	<87%>
	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to make merry withal?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<VINCENTIO>	<88%>
	Art thou his father?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<VINCENTIO>	<88%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Seeing Biondello.>
</STAGE DIR> Come hither, crack-hemp.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<VINCENTIO>	<88%>
	Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<VINCENTIO>	<88%>
	What, you notorious villain! didst thou never see thy master's father, Vincentio?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<VINCENTIO>	<88%>
	Is't so, indeed?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<VINCENTIO>	<89%>
	What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! while I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<VINCENTIO>	<89%>
	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<VINCENTIO>	<89%>
	His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<VINCENTIO>	<90%>
	Lucentio! O! he hath murdered his master. Lay hold on him, I charge you in the duke's name. O my son, my son! tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<VINCENTIO>	<90%>
	Carry me to the gaol!
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<VINCENTIO>	<90%>
	Thus strangers may be haled and abused: O monstrous villain!

</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<VINCENTIO>	<91%>
	Lives my sweetest son?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<VINCENTIO>	<91%>
	Where is that damned villain Tranio,
	That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<VINCENTIO>	<91%>
	I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent me to the gaol.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<VINCENTIO>	<91%>
	Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<VINCENTIO>	<94%>
	Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
</VINCENTIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<VINCENTIO>	<100%>
	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
</VINCENTIO>
