	Gentlemen, importune me no further,

	If either of you both love Katharina,

	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
	Go in, Bianca.

<Exit Bianca.>

	And for I know she taketh most delight
	In music, instruments, and poetry,
	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
	I will be very kind, and liberal
	To mine own children in good bringing up;
	And so, farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
	For I have more to commune with Bianca.

<BAPTISTA>	<32%>
	Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
	Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
	For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
	Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

</BAPTISTA>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
<BAPTISTA>	<46%>
	I must confess your offer is the best;

	Well, gentlemen,
	I am thus resolv'd. On Sunday next, you know,

	Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
	If not, to Signior Gremio:

</STAGE DIR> Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day

	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
	What will be said? what mockery will it be
	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
</BAPTISTA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<BAPTISTA>	<51%>
	Go, girl: I cannot blame thee now to weep,

	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,

	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
	That like a father you will deal with him
	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
	The match is made, and all is done:
	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
</BAPTISTA>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
<BAPTISTA>	<81%>
	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.

<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>

	It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
