	Mi perdonate, gentle master mine,
	I am in all affected as yourself,
	Glad that you thus continue your resolve
	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
	Only, good master, while we do admire
	This virtue and this moral discipline,
	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
	Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
	Music and poesy use to quicken you;
	The mathematics and the metaphysics,
	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
<TRANIO>	<13%>
	Master, some show to welcome us to town.

</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<TRANIO>	<14%>
	Hush, master! here is some good pastime toward:
	That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<TRANIO>	<14%>
	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
<TRANIO>	<16%>
	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
<TRANIO>	<17%>
	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
	Affection is not rated from the heart:
	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
	Redime te captum, quam queas minimo.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
<TRANIO>	<17%>
	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
<TRANIO>	<17%>
	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
	Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,
	That till the father rid his hands of her,
	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><16%>
<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Master, for my hand,
	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
<TRANIO>	<18%>
	You will be schoolmaster,
	And undertake the teaching of the maid:
	That's your device.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
<TRANIO>	<18%>
	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son?
	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;
	Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><17%>
<TRANIO>	<19%>
	So had you need.
	In brief then, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
	And I am tied to be obedient;
	For so your father charg'd me at our parting,
	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
	Although I think 'twas in another sense:
	I am content to be Lucentio,
	Because so well I love Lucentio.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><18%>
<TRANIO>	<20%>
	So would I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
	But in all places else your master, Lucentio.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<28%>
	Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
	Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
	To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Even he, Biondello!
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
	For me as for you?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	For what reason, I beseech you?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
<TRANIO>	<29%>
	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
	Do me this right; hear me with patience.
	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
	To whom my father is not all unknown;
	And were his daughter fairer than she is,
	She may more suitors have, and me for one.
	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
	Then well one more may fair Bianca have,
	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><28%>
<TRANIO>	<30%>
	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
	The one as famous for a scolding tongue
	As is the other for beauteous modesty.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
<TRANIO>	<30%>
	If it be so, sir, that you are the man
	Must stead us all, and me among the rest;
	And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
	Achieve the elder, set the younger free
	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><29%>
<TRANIO>	<30%>
	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
	And do as adversaries do in law,
	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
<TRANIO>	<34%>
	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
	That, being a stranger in this city here,
	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
	This liberty is all that I request,
	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
	And free access and favour as the rest:
	And, toward the education of your daughters,
	I here bestow a simple instrument,
	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
	If you accept them, then their worth is great.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>

	Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

	'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
<TRANIO>	<44%>
	And I am one that love Bianca more
	Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<TRANIO>	<44%>
	Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.

	But youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<TRANIO>	<45%>
	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
	I am my father's heir and only son:
	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
	Of fruitful land, all of which shall be her jointure.
	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
<TRANIO>	<45%>
	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
	Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
	And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,
	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
<TRANIO>	<45%>
	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
	By your firm promise. Gremio is out-vied.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
<TRANIO>	<46%>
	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
</TRANIO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><45%>
<TRANIO>	<46%>
	A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
	Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
	'Tis in my head to do my master good:
	I see no reason, but suppos'd Lucentio
	Must get a father, called 'suppos'd Vincentio;'
	And that's a wonder: fathers, commonly
	Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
	A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

	To save your life in this extremity,
