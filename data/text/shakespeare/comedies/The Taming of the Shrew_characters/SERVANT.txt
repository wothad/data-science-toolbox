	An it please your honour,
	Players that offer service to your lordship.

	Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
	Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
	For so your doctors hold it very meet,
	Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
	And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
	Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,
	And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
	Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

	Mistress, your father prays you leave your books,
	And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
	You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
