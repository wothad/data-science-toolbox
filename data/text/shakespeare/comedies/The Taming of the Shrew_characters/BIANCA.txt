<BIANCA>	<14%>
	Sister, content you in my discontent.
	Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
	My books and instruments shall be my company,
	On them to look and practise by myself.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
<BIANCA>	<31%>
	Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
	To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
	That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
	Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
	Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
	Or what you will command me will I do,
	So well I know my duty to my elders.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<BIANCA>	<31%>
	Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
	I never yet beheld that special face
	Which I could fancy more than any other.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<BIANCA>	<31%>
	If you affect him, sister, here I swear
	I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<BIANCA>	<31%>
	Is it for him you do envy me so?
	Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
	You have but jested with me all this while:
	I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<BIANCA>	<47%>
	Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
	To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
	I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
	I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
	But learn my lessons as I please myself.
	And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
	Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
	His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<BIANCA>	<48%>
	Where left we last?
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<BIANCA>	<48%>
	Construe them.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<BIANCA>	<48%>
	Let's hear.—
<STAGE DIR>
<Hortensio plays.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O fie! the treble jars.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<BIANCA>	<48%>
	Now let me see if I can construe it: Hac ibat Simois, I know you not, hic est Sigeia tellus, I trust you not; Hic steterat Priami, take heed he hear us not, regia, presume not; celsa senis, despair not.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<BIANCA>	<48%>
	In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<BIANCA>	<49%>
	I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
	I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
	But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
	Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
	That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<BIANCA>	<49%>
	Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<BIANCA>	<49%>

	'Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
	'A re,' to plead Hortensio's passion;
	'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
	'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
	'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
	'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.

	Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
	Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
	To change true rules for odd inventions.

</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<BIANCA>	<50%>
	Farewell, sweet masters both: I must be gone.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>

	That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BIANCA>	<68%>
	What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BIANCA>	<68%>
	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BIANCA>	<69%>
	Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BIANCA>	<69%>
	God give him joy!
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BIANCA>	<69%>
	He says so, Tranio.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BIANCA>	<69%>
	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<BIANCA>	<91%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneeling.>
</STAGE DIR> Pardon, dear father.

	Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<BIANCA>	<94%>
	Head and butt! a hasty-witted body
	Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<BIANCA>	<94%>
	Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<BIANCA>	<94%>
	Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
	And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
	You are welcome all.
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<BIANCA>	<98%>
	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
</BIANCA>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<BIANCA>	<98%>
	The more fool you for laying on my duty.
</BIANCA>
