	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not of.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<ANTONIO>	<12%>
	As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and, if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
<ANTONIO>	<12%>
	A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><15%>
<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	I saw him not.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><16%>
<ANTONIO>	<16%>
	In faith, she's too curst.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>

<STAGE DIR>
<To Hero.>
</STAGE DIR> Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<ANTONIO>	<19%>
	At a word, I am not.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<ANTONIO>	<19%>
	To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<ANTONIO>	<20%>
	At a word, I am not.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
<ANTONIO>	<77%>
	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself;
	And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
	Against yourself.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<ANTONIO>	<79%>
	Therein do men from children nothing differ.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<ANTONIO>	<79%>
	Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
	Make those that do offend you suffer too.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<ANTONIO>	<79%>
	Here come the prince and Claudio hastily.

</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<ANTONIO>	<79%>
	If he could right himself with quarrelling,
	Some of us would lie low.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<ANTONIO>	<80%>
	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
	But that's no matter; let him kill one first:
	Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
	Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me.
	Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
	Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<ANTONIO>	<81%>
	Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece;
	And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
	That dare as well answer a man indeed
	As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
	Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<ANTONIO>	<81%>
	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
	And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,
	Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
	That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
	Go antickly, show outward hideousness,
	And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
	How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
	And this is all!
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ANTONIO>	<81%>
	Come, 'tis no matter:
	Do not you meddle, let me deal in this.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ANTONIO>	<81%>
	And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Leonato and Antonio.>
</STAGE DIR>

</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<ANTONIO>	<90%>
	Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
<ANTONIO>	<95%>
	Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<ANTONIO>	<95%>
	Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
<ANTONIO>	<97%>
	This same is she, and I do give you her.
</ANTONIO>
