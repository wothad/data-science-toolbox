	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
	Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
	To her he thinks not worthy; yet he woos;
	Yet will he swear he loves.

 Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
	Men were deceivers ever;
	One foot in sea, and one on shore,
	To one thing constant never.
	Then sigh not so,
	But let them go,
	And be you blithe and bonny,
	Converting all your sounds of woe
	Into Hey nonny, nonny.
	Sing no more ditties, sing no mo
	Of dumps so dull and heavy;
	The fraud of men was ever so,
	Since summer first was leavy.
	Then sigh not so,
	But let them go,
	And be you blithe and bonny,
	Converting all your sounds of woe
	Into Hey nonny, nonny.
