	A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><0%>
<LEONATO>	<1%>
	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<LEONATO>	<1%>
	Did he break out into tears?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<LEONATO>	<1%>
	A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed: how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!

	What is he that you ask for, niece?

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>

	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<LEONATO>	<2%>
	You must not, sir, mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them.

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><15%>
<LEONATO>	<16%>
	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><16%>

	So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>

	Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<LEONATO>	<27%>
	There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<LEONATO>	<28%>
	O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<LEONATO>	<28%>
	O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<LEONATO>	<28%>
	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<LEONATO>	<28%>
	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<LEONATO>	<35%>
	No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<LEONATO>	<35%>
	By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<LEONATO>	<35%>
	O God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.

<LEONATO>	<35%>
	What effects, my lord? She will sit you; <STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> You heard my daughter tell you how.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<LEONATO>	<36%>
	I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<LEONATO>	<36%>
	No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<LEONATO>	<36%>
	This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<LEONATO>	<36%>
	O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<LEONATO>	<37%>
	O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should.'
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<LEONATO>	<37%>
	She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<LEONATO>	<37%>
	O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<LEONATO>	<38%>
	Were it good, think you?

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<LEONATO>	<38%>
	If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<LEONATO>	<39%>
	Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<LEONATO>	<39%>
	My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
<LEONATO>	<46%>
	So say I: methinks you are sadder.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 2><45%>
<LEONATO>	<47%>
	Where is but a humour or a worm?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>

</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 5><59%>

	What is it, my good friends?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 5><60%>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 5><60%>

</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 5><61%>

	Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 5><61%>
<LEONATO>	<62%>
	I must leave you.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 5><61%>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>

	What do you mean, my lord?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<LEONATO>	<64%>
	Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
	Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
	And made defeat of her virginity,—
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<LEONATO>	<65%>
	Sweet prince, why speak not you?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<LEONATO>	<65%>
	Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<LEONATO>	<65%>
	All this is so; but what of this, my lord?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<LEONATO>	<65%>
	I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LEONATO>	<66%>
	Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LEONATO>	<67%>
	O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand:
	Death is the fairest cover for her shame
	That may be wish'd for.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LEONATO>	<67%>
	Dost thou look up?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LEONATO>	<67%>
	Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
	Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
	The story that is printed in her blood?
	Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes;
	For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
	Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
	Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
	Strike at thy life. Griev'd I, I had but one?
	Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
	O! one too much by thee. Why had I one?
	Why ever wast thou lovely in mine eyes?
	Why had I not with charitable hand
	Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
	Who smirched thus, and mir'd with infamy,
	I might have said, 'No part of it is mine;
	This shame derives itself from unknown loins?'
	But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd,
	And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
	That I myself was to myself not mine,
	Valuing of her; why, she—O! she is fallen
	Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
	Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,
	And salt too little which may season give
	To her foul-tainted flesh.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<LEONATO>	<68%>
	Confirm'd, confirm'd! O! that is stronger made,
	Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron.
	Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie,
	Who lov'd her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
	Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 82><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<LEONATO>	<69%>
	Friar, it cannot be.
	Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
	Is, that she will not add to her damnation
	A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
	Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
	That which appears in proper nakedness?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 83><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<LEONATO>	<69%>
	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
	These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
	The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
	Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine.
	Nor age so eat up my invention,
	Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
	Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
	But they shall find, awak'd in such a kind,
	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
	Ability in means and choice of friends,
	To quit me of them throughly.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<LEONATO>	<70%>
	What shall become of this? What will this do?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<LEONATO>	<71%>
	Being that I flow in grief,
	The smallest twine may lead me.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
<LEONATO>	<78%>
	I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
	Which falls into mine ears as profitless
	As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
	Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
	But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine:
	Bring me a father that so lov'd his child,
	Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
	And bid him speak of patience;
	Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,
	And let it answer every strain for strain,
	As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
	In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
	If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard;
	Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan,
	Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk
	With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
	And I of him will gather patience.
	But there is no such man; for, brother, men
	Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
	Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
	Their counsel turns to passion, which before
	Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
	Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
	Charm ache with air and agony with words.
	No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
	To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
	But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
	To be so moral when he shall endure
	The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
	My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<LEONATO>	<79%>
	I pray thee, peace! I will be flesh and blood;
	For there was never yet philosopher
	That could endure the toothache patiently,
	However they have writ the style of gods
	And made a push at chance and sufferance.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<LEONATO>	<79%>
	There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
	My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
	And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince,
	And all of them that thus dishonour her.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LEONATO>	<79%>
	Hear you, my lords,—
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LEONATO>	<79%>
	Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
	Are you so hasty now?—well, all is one.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LEONATO>	<79%>
	Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou.
	Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
	I fear thee not.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LEONATO>	<80%>
	Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me:
	I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
	As, under privilege of age, to brag
	What I have done being young, or what would do,
	Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
	Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
	That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by,
	And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
	Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
	I say thou hast belied mine innocent child:
	Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
	And she lies buried with her ancestors;
	O! in a tomb where never scandal slept,
	Save this of hers, fram'd by thy villany!
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LEONATO>	<80%>
	Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LEONATO>	<80%>
	My lord, my lord,
	I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
	Despite his nice fence and his active practice,
	His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LEONATO>	<80%>
	Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child;

	My lord, my lord—
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<LEONATO>	<81%>
	No?
	Come, brother, away. I will be heard.—
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<LEONATO>	<87%>
	Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,
	That, when I note another man like him,

</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<LEONATO>	<87%>
	Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
	Mine innocent child?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<LEONATO>	<87%>
	No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
	Here stand a pair of honourable men;
	A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
	I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death
	Record it with your high and worthy deeds.
	'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<LEONATO>	<88%>
	I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
	That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
	Possess the people in Messina here
	How innocent she died; and if your love
	Can labour aught in sad invention,
	Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,
	And sing it to her bones: sing it to-night.
	To-morrow morning come you to my house,
	And since you could not be my son-in-law,
	Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,
	Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
	And she alone is heir to both of us:
	Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
	And so dies my revenge.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<LEONATO>	<88%>
	To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
	To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
	Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
	Who, I believe, was pack'd in all this wrong,
	Hir'd to it by your brother.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<LEONATO>	<89%>
	I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>

	There's for thy pains.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>

	Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<LEONATO>	<90%>
	Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<LEONATO>	<90%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To the Watch.>
</STAGE DIR> Bring you these fellows on. We'll talk with Margaret,
	How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
<LEONATO>	<95%>
	So are the prince and Claudio, who accus'd her
	Upon the error that you heard debated:
	But Margaret was in some fault for this,
	Although against her will, as it appears
	In the true course of all the question.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>
<LEONATO>	<95%>
	Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
	Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
	And when I send for you, come hither mask'd:
	The prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour
	To visit me.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt ladies.>
</STAGE DIR>
	You know your office, brother;
	You must be father to your brother's daughter,
	And give her to young Claudio.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<LEONATO>	<96%>
	That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<LEONATO>	<96%>
	The sight whereof I think, you had from me,
	From Claudio, and the prince. But what's your will?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<LEONATO>	<96%>
	My heart is with your liking.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
<LEONATO>	<96%>
	Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
	We here attend you. Are you yet determin'd
	To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
<LEONATO>	<96%>
	Call her forth, brother: here's the friar ready.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
<LEONATO>	<97%>
	No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
	Before this friar, and swear to marry her.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<LEONATO>	<97%>
	She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
<LEONATO>	<98%>
	Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
</LEONATO>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
<LEONATO>	<100%>
	We'll have dancing afterward.
</LEONATO>
