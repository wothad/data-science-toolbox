	I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<URSULA>	<19%>
	I know you by the waggling of your head.

	You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<URSULA>	<20%>
	Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an end.

	The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
	Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
	And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
	So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
	Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
	Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<URSULA>	<43%>
	But are you sure
	That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<URSULA>	<43%>
	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<URSULA>	<43%>
	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
	Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
	As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<URSULA>	<43%>
	Sure, I think so;
	And therefore certainly it were not good
	She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<URSULA>	<44%>
	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<URSULA>	<44%>
	Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<URSULA>	<44%>
	O! do not do your cousin such a wrong.
	She cannot be so much without true judgment,—
	Having so swift and excellent a wit
	As she is priz'd to have,—as to refuse
	So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<URSULA>	<45%>
	I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
	Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
	For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
	Goes foremost in report through Italy.

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>

	His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
	When are you married, madam?
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<URSULA>	<45%>
	She's lim'd, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<URSULA>	<57%>
	I will, lady.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 4><56%>
<URSULA>	<57%>
	Well.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<URSULA>	<60%>
	Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town, are come to fetch you to church.
</URSULA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<URSULA>	<93%>
	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?
