	But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them come before Master constable.

	Master constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.

	What heard you him say else?

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
<SEXTON>	<76%>

	And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show him their examination.
