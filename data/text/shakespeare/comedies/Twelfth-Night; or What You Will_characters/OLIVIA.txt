	O! you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.

	Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,

	To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
	Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
	Have you not set mine honour at the stake,

	O! what a deal of scorn looks beautiful

	A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon

	Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
	By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing,
	I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
	Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
	Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
	For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;

	Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better.

</STAGE DIR> Read it you, sirrah.

	Did he write this?

	See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.

<Exit Fabian.>
</STAGE DIR>
	My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
	To think me as well a sister as a wife,
	One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
	Here at my house and at my proper cost.

<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>

	A sister! you are she.

	Ay, my lord, this same.
	How now, Malvolio!

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<OLIVIA>	<97%>
	Have I, Malvolio? no.

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<OLIVIA>	<98%>
	Alas! Malvolio, this is not my writing,
	Though, I confess, much like the character;
	But, out of question, 'tis Maria's hand:
	And now I do bethink me, it was she
	First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
	And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
	Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
	This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
	But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
	Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
	Of thine own cause.

	Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

	He hath been most notoriously abus'd.
