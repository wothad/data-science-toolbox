	If music be the food of love, play on;
	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
	The appetite may sicken, and so die.
	That strain again! it had a dying fall:
	O! it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
	That breathes upon a bank of violets,
	Stealing and giving odour. Enough! no more:
	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
	That, notwithstanding thy capacity
	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
	But falls into abatement and low price,
	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy,
	That it alone is high fantastical.

	O! when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
	Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence.

	E'er since pursue me.

	O! she that hath a heart of that fine frame
	To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else

	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
	Her sweet perfections with one self king.
	Away before me to sweet beds of flowers;

	Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,

	Till thou have audience.

	O! then unfold the passion of my love;
	Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
	It shall become thee well to act my woes;

	Than in a nuncio of more grave aspect.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><10%>
<DUKE>	<11%>
	Dear lad, believe it;
	For they shall yet belie thy happy years
	That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
	Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
	Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound;
	And all is semblative a woman's part.
	I know thy constellation is right apt
	For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
	All, if you will; for I myself am best
	When least in company. Prosper well in this,
	And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
	To call his fortunes thine.

	Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends:
	Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
	That old and antique song we heard last night;
	Methought it did relieve my passion much,
	More than light airs and recollected terms
	Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
	Come; but one verse.

	Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
	In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
	For such as I am all true lovers are:
	Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
	Save in the constant image of the creature
	That is belov'd. How dost thou like this tune?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<DUKE>	<35%>
	Thou dost speak masterly.
	My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye

	Hath it not, boy?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<DUKE>	<35%>
	What kind of woman is't?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>

	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<DUKE>	<36%>
	Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take
	An elder than herself, so wears she to him,
	So sways she level in her husband's heart:
	For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
	Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
	More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
	Than women's are.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<DUKE>	<36%>
	Then, let thy love be younger than thyself,
	Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
	For women are as roses, whose fair flower
	Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<DUKE>	<36%>
	O, fellow! come, the song we had last night.
	Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain;
	The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,
	And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,
	Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
	And dallies with the innocence of love,
	Like the old age.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>

	Once more, Cesario,
	Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
	Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
	Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
	The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
	Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
	But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
	That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>

	There is no woman's sides
	Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
	As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
	So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.
	Alas! their love may be call'd appetite,
	No motion of the liver, but the palate,
	That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
	But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
	And can digest as much. Make no compare
	Between that love a woman can bear me
	And that I owe Olivia.

	That face of his I do remember well;

	A bawbling vessel was he captain of,

	With which such scathful grapple did he make
	With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
	That very envy and the tongue of loss
	Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?

	Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,

	Live you, the marble-breasted tyrant still;
	But this your minion, whom I know you love,

	Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
	Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
	Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief;
	I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
