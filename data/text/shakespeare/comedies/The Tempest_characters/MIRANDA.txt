	If by your art, my dearest father, you have
	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
	But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
	Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffer'd
	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
	Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her,
	Dash'd all to pieces. O! the cry did knock
	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
	Had I been any god of power, I would
	Have sunk the sea within the earth, or e'er
	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
	The fraughting souls within her.

	You have often

	Concluding, 'Stay; not yet.'
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<MIRANDA>	<6%>
	Certainly, sir, I can.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>

	'Tis far off;

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<MIRANDA>	<7%>
	O! my heart bleeds

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>

	Alack, for pity!
	I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>

	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,—

	'Tis a villain, sir,

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
<MIRANDA>	<24%>
	What is't? a spirit?
	Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,

	I might call him

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
<MIRANDA>	<24%>
	No wonder, sir;

<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Why speaks my father so ungently? This

	There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:

<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
<MIRANDA>	<27%>
	O dear father!
	Make not too rash a trial of him, for
	He's gentle, and not fearful.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
<MIRANDA>	<27%>
	Beseech you, father!
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 2><26%>
<MIRANDA>	<27%>
	Sir, have pity:
	I'll be his surety.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<MIRANDA>	<27%>
	My affections
	Are then most humble; I have no ambition

</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><27%>
<MIRANDA>	<28%>
	Be of comfort;
	My father's of a better nature, sir,
	Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted,
	Which now came from him.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
<MIRANDA>	<53%>
	Alas! now, pray you,
	Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
	Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
	Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
	'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
	Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself:
	He's safe for these three hours.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
<MIRANDA>	<53%>
	If you'll sit down,
	I'll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that;
	I'll carry it to the pile.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
<MIRANDA>	<54%>
	It would become me
	As well as it does you: and I should do it
	With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
	And yours it is against.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
<MIRANDA>	<54%>
	You look wearily.

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>

	Miranda.—O my father!
	I have broke your hest to say so.

<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<MIRANDA>	<55%>
	I do not know
	One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
	Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
	More that I may call men than you, good friend,
	And my dear father: how features are abroad,
	I am skill-less of; but, by my modesty,—
	The jewel in my dower,—I would not wish
	Any companion in the world but you;
	Nor can imagination form a shape,
	Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
	Something too wildly and my father's precepts
	I therein do forget.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<MIRANDA>	<55%>
	Do you love me?
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<MIRANDA>	<56%>
	I am a fool
	To weep at what I am glad of.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<MIRANDA>	<56%>
	At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
	What I desire to give; and much less take
	What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
	And all the more it seeks to hide itself
	The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
	And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
	I am your wife, if you will marry me;
	If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
	You may deny me; but I'll be your servant
	Whether you will or no.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<MIRANDA>	<56%>
	My husband then?
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
<MIRANDA>	<57%>
	And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell
	Till half an hour hence.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 1><77%>
<MIRANDA>	<77%>
	Never till this day
	Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<MIRANDA>	<92%>
	Sweet lord, you play me false.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<MIRANDA>	<92%>
	Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
	And I would call it fair play.
</MIRANDA>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>

	O, wonder!
	How many goodly creatures are there here!
	How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
	That has such people in't!
