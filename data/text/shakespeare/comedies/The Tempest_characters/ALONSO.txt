	Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<ALONSO>	<29%>
	Prithee, peace.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
<ALONSO>	<30%>
	I prithee, spare.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
<ALONSO>	<32%>
	Ay?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
<ALONSO>	<33%>
	You cram these words into mine ears, against
	The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
	Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
	My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,
	Who is so far from Italy remov'd,
	I ne'er again shall see her. O thou, mine heir
	Of Naples and of Milan! what strange fish
	Hath made his meal on thee?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
<ALONSO>	<34%>
	No, no; he's gone.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
<ALONSO>	<34%>
	Prithee, peace.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><34%>
<ALONSO>	<34%>
	So is the dearest of the loss.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>
<ALONSO>	<36%>
	Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ALONSO>	<37%>
	What! all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
	Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
	They are inclin'd to do so.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ALONSO>	<37%>
	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<ALONSO>	<42%>
	Why, how now! ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
	Wherefore this ghastly looking?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<ALONSO>	<43%>
	I heard nothing.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<ALONSO>	<43%>
	Heard you this, Gonzalo?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<ALONSO>	<43%>
	Lead off this ground, and let's make further search
	For my poor son.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><44%>
<ALONSO>	<43%>
	Lead away.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
<ALONSO>	<64%>
	Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
	Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
	To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
	Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
	No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
	Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks
	Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 3><66%>
<ALONSO>	<65%>
	What harmony is this? my good friends, hark!
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><66%>
<ALONSO>	<65%>
	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
<ALONSO>	<66%>
	I cannot too much muse,
	Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing,—
	Although they want the use of tongue,—a kind
	Of excellent dumb discourse.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
<ALONSO>	<67%>
	Not I.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 3><67%>
<ALONSO>	<67%>
	I will stand to and feed,
	Although my last; no matter, since I feel
	The best is past.—Brother, my lord the duke,
	Stand to and do as we.

</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><70%>
<ALONSO>	<69%>
	O, it is monstrous! monstrous!
	Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
	The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
	That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc'd
	The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
	Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded; and
	I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded,
	And with him there lie mudded.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<ALONSO>	<89%>
	Whe'r thou beest he or no,
	Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
	As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
	Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
	Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which,
	I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,—
	An if this be at all—a most strange story.
	Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
	Thou pardon me my wrongs.—But how should Prospero
	Be living, and be here?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ALONSO>	<90%>
	If thou beest Prospero,
	Give us particulars of thy preservation;
	How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
	Were wrack'd upon this shore; where I have lost,—
	How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—
	My dear son Ferdinand.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ALONSO>	<90%>
	Irreparable is the loss, and patience
	Says it is past her cure.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ALONSO>	<90%>
	You the like loss!
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ALONSO>	<91%>
	A daughter?
	O heavens! that they were living both in Naples,
	The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
	Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
	Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ALONSO>	<92%>
	If this prove
	A vision of the island, one dear son
	Shall I twice lose.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ALONSO>	<92%>
	Now, all the blessings
	Of a glad father compass thee about!
	Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ALONSO>	<92%>
	What is this maid, with whom thou wast at play?
	Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
	Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
	And brought us thus together?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<ALONSO>	<93%>
	I am hers:
	But O! how oddly will it sound that I
	Must ask my child forgiveness!
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<ALONSO>	<93%>
	I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>

<STAGE DIR>
<To Fer. and Mira.>
</STAGE DIR> Give me your hands:
	Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
	That doth not wish you joy!
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<ALONSO>	<95%>
	These are not natural events; they strengthen
	From strange to stranger.—Say, how came you hither?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><95%>
<ALONSO>	<95%>
	This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
	And there is in this business more than nature
	Was ever conduct of: some oracle
	Must rectify our knowledge.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<ALONSO>	<97%>
	Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<ALONSO>	<97%>
	And Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they
	Find this grand liquor that hath gilded them?
	How cam'st thou in this pickle?
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<ALONSO>	<98%>
	This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
<ALONSO>	<98%>
	Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
</ALONSO>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><98%>
<ALONSO>	<99%>
	I long
	To hear the story of your life, which must
	Take the ear strangely.
</ALONSO>
