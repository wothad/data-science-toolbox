	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.—

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><36%>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTONIO>	<36%>
	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTONIO>	<37%>
	Go sleep, and hear us.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTONIO>	<37%>
	We two, my lord,
	Will guard your person while you take your rest,

</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTONIO>	<37%>
	It is the quality o' the climate.

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTONIO>	<37%>
	Nor I: my spirits are nimble.
	They fell together all, as by consent;
	They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
	Worthy Sebastian? O! what might?—No more:—
	And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
	What thou should'st be. The occasion speaks thee; and
	My strong imagination sees a crown
	Dropping upon thy head.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTONIO>	<38%>
	Do you not hear me speak?
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTONIO>	<38%>
	Noble Sebastian,
	Thou let'st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink'st
	Whiles thou art waking.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTONIO>	<38%>
	I am more serious than my custom: you
	Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
	Trebles thee o'er.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
<ANTONIO>	<38%>
	I'll teach you how to flow.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
<ANTONIO>	<38%>
	O!
	If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
	Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
	You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
	Most often do so near the bottom run
	By their own fear or sloth.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
<ANTONIO>	<39%>
	Thus, sir:
	Although this lord of weak remembrance, this
	Who shall be of as little memory
	When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded,—
	For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
	Professes to persuade,—the king, his son's alive,
	'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
	As he that sleeps here swims.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><39%>
<ANTONIO>	<39%>
	O! out of that 'no hope
	What great hope have you! no hope that way is
	Another way so high a hope that even
	Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
	But doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me
	That Ferdinand is drown'd?
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
<ANTONIO>	<39%>
	Then tell me
	Who's the next heir of Naples?
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
<ANTONIO>	<39%>
	She that is Queen of Tums; she that dwells
	Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
	Can have no note, unless the sun were post—
	The man i' th' moon's too slow—till new-born chins
	Be rough and razorable: she that, from whom?
	We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
	And by that destiny to perform an act
	Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
	In yours and my discharge.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 1><40%>
<ANTONIO>	<40%>
	A space whose every cubit
	Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
	Measure us back to Naples?—Keep in Tunis,
	And let Sebastian wake!'—Say, this were death
	That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse
	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
	As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
	As amply and unnecessarily
	As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
	The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
	For your advancement! Do you understand me?
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
<ANTONIO>	<40%>
	And how does your content
	Tender your own good fortune?
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
<ANTONIO>	<41%>
	True:
	And look how well my garments sit upon me;
	Much feater than before; my brother's servants
	Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><41%>
<ANTONIO>	<41%>
	Ay, sir; where lies that? if it were a kibe,
	'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
	This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
	That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they,
	And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
	No better than the earth he lies upon,
	If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
	Whom I, with this obedient steel,—three inches of it,—
	Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
	To the perpetual wink for aye might put
	This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
	Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
	They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
	They'll tell the clock to any business that
	We say befits the hour.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
<ANTONIO>	<42%>
	Draw together;
	And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
	To fall it on Gonzalo.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 1><42%>
<ANTONIO>	<42%>
	Then let us both be sudden.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 1><43%>
<ANTONIO>	<43%>
	O! 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
	To make an earthquake: sure it was the roar
	Of a whole herd of lions.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
<ANTONIO>	<64%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Seb.>
</STAGE DIR> I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
	Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
	That you resolv'd to effect.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 3><65%>
<ANTONIO>	<65%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Seb.>
</STAGE DIR> Let it be to-night;
	For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
	Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
	As when they are fresh.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 3><66%>
<ANTONIO>	<66%>
	I'll believe both;
	And what does else want credit, come to me,
	And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie,
	Though fools at home condemn them.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 3><70%>
<ANTONIO>	<70%>
	I'll be thy second.
</ANTONIO>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
<ANTONIO>	<97%>
	Very like; one of them
	Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
</ANTONIO>
