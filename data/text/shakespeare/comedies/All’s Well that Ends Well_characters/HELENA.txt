	O! were that all. I think not on my father;
	And these great tears grace his remembrance more
	Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
	I have forgot him: my imagination
	Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
	I am undone: there is no living, none,
	If Bertram be away. It were all one
	That I should love a bright particular star
	And think to wed it, he is so above me:
	In his bright radiance and collateral light
	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
	The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
	The hind that would be mated by the lion
	Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
	To see him every hour; to sit and draw
	His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
	In our heart's table; heart too capable
	Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
	But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
	Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
	One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
	And yet I know him a notorious liar,
	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
	Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him,
	That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
	Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
	Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

<HELENA>	<17%>
	Then, I confess,
	Here on my knee, before high heaven and you
	That before you, and next unto high heaven,
	I love your son.
	My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
	Be not offended, for it hurts not him
	That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not
	By any token of presumptuous suit;
	Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
	Yet never know how that desert should be.
	I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
	Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve
	I still pour in the waters of my love,
	And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
	Religious in mine error, I adore
	The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
	But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
	Let not your hate encounter with my love
	For loving where you do: but, if yourself,
	Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
	Did ever in so true a flame of liking
	Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
	Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity
	To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
	But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
	That seeks not to find that her search implies,
	But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.

	I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
	You know my father left me some prescriptions
	Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
	And manifest experience had collected
	For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
	In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
	As notes whose faculties inclusive were
	More than they were in note. Amongst the rest,
	There is a remedy, approv'd, set down
	To cure the desperate languishings whereof
	The king is render'd lost.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<HELENA>	<18%>
	My lord your son made me to think of this;

	Haply been absent then.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<HELENA>	<19%>
	There's something in't,
	More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
	Of his profession, that his good receipt
	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
	But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
	The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure,
	By such a day, and hour.

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<HELENA>	<23%>
	The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
	Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
	Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
	Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
	And of his old experience the only darling,
	He bade me store up as a triple eye,
	Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so;
	And, hearing your high majesty is touch'd
	With that malignant cause wherein the honour
	Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
	I come to tender it and my appliance,
	With all bound humbleness.

	Oft expectation fails, and most oft there

	Please it this matron and this gentle maid
	To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
	Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
	I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
	Worthy the note.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
<HELENA>	<60%>
	If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
	I know not how I shall assure you further,
	But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
<HELENA>	<60%>
	Nor would I wish you.
	First, give me trust, the county is my husband,
	And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
	Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
	By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
	Err in bestowing it.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
<HELENA>	<61%>
	Take this purse of gold,
	And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
	Which I will over-pay and pay again
	When I have found it. The county woos your daughter,
	Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
	Resolv'd to carry her: let her in fine consent,
	As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
	Now, his important blood will nought deny
	That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
	That down ward hath succeeded in his house
	From son to son, some four or five descents
	Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
	In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
	To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
	Howe'er repented after.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
<HELENA>	<61%>
	You see it lawful then. It is no more,
	But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
	Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,
	In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
	Herself most chastely absent. After this,
	To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
	To what is past already.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 96><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
<HELENA>	<61%>
	Why then to-night
	Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
	Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
	And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
	Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
	But let's about it.

<SPEECH 97><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<HELENA>	<79%>
	That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
	One of the greatest in the Christian world
	Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
	Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
	Time was I did him a desired office,
	Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
	Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
	And answer, thanks. I duly am inform'd
	His Grace is at Marseilles; to which place
	We have convenient convoy. You must know,
	I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
	My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
	And by the leave of my good lord the king,
	We'll be before our welcome.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 98><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
<HELENA>	<80%>
	Nor you, mistress,
	Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
	To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
	Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
	As it hath fated her to be my motive
	And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
	That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
	When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
	Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
	With what it loathes for that which is away.
	But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
	Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
	Something in my behalf.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 99><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
<HELENA>	<80%>
	Yet, I pray you:
	But with the word the time will bring on summer,
	When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
	And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
	Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us:
	All's well that ends well: still the fine's the crown;
	Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

<SPEECH 100><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<HELENA>	<84%>
	But this exceeding posting, day and night,
	Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
	But since you have made the days and nights as one,
	To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
	Be bold you do so grow in my requital
	As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a gentle Astringer.>

	This man may help me to his majesty's ear,

<SPEECH 101><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
	From the report that goes upon your goodness;
	And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
	Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
	The use of your own virtues, for the which
	I shall continue thankful.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	That it will please you
	To give this poor petition to the king,
	And aid me with that store of power you have
	To come into his presence.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	Not here, sir!
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	All's well that ends well yet,
	Though time seems so adverse and means unfit.
	I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<HELENA>	<85%>
	I do beseech you, sir,
	Since you are like to see the king before me,
	Commend the paper to his gracious hand;
	Which I presume shall render you no blame
	But rather make you thank your pains for it.
	I will come after you with what good speed
	Our means will make us means.
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<HELENA>	<86%>
	And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
	Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again:
	Go, go, provide.

<HELENA>	<99%>
	No, my good lord;
	'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see;
	The name and not the thing.

<SPEECH 109><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<HELENA>	<99%>
	O my good lord! when I was like this maid,
	I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
	And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
	When from my finger you can get this ring,
	And are by me with child, &c. This is done:
	Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
</HELENA>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>

	If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,
	Deadly divorce step between me and you!
	O! my dear mother; do I see you living?
