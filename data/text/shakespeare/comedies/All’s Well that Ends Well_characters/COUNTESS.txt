	This young gentlewoman had a father,—O, that 'had!' how sad a passage 'tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's disease.

	His sole child, my lord; and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises: her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too: in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

	'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena, go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow, than have it.

	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
	Under thy own life's key: be check'd for silence,

	Even so it was with me when I was young:
	If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
	Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
	Our blood to us, this to our blood is born:
	It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
	Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
	By our remembrances of days foregone,
	Such were our faults; or then we thought them none.
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<COUNTESS>	<15%>
	You know, Helen,
	I am a mother to you.
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<COUNTESS>	<15%>
	Nay, a mother:
	Why not a mother? When I said, 'a mother,'
	Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother'
	That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
	And put you in the catalogue of those
	That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
	Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
	A native slip to us from foreign seeds;
	You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
	Yet I express to you a mother's care.
	God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
	To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
	That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
	The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
	Why? that you are my daughter?
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
<COUNTESS>	<16%>
	I say, I am your mother.
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>

	Nor I your mother?
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
<COUNTESS>	<16%>
	Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
	God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
	So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
	My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
	The mystery of your loneliness, and find
	Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
	You love my son: invention is asham'd,
	Against the proclamation of thy passion,
	To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
	But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
	Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
	See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
	That in their kind they speak it: only sin
	And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
	That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
	If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
	If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
	As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
	To tell me truly.

<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>

	But think you, Helen,
	If you should tender your supposed aid,
	He would receive it? He and his physicians
	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
	They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
	The danger to itself?

	Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<COUNTESS>	<46%>
	I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not' eternal. You shall hear I am ran away: know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
	Your unfortunate son,
 BERTRAM.
 This is not well: rash and unbridled boy,
	To fly the favours of so good a king!

	For the contempt of empire!
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>

	Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
	I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,

</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>

	Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<COUNTESS>	<48%>
	I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
	If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,

	And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

	Nothing in France until he have no wife!

	Parolles, was it not?

<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>

	Y'are welcome, gentlemen.

	Alas! and would you take the letter of her?

<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
<COUNTESS>	<51%>
	Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
	Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,

</COUNTESS>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
<COUNTESS>	<52%>
	What angel shall
	Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
	Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear,
	And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
	Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
	To this unworthy husband of his wife;
	Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
	That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief,
	Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
	Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
	When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
	He will return; and hope I may that she,
	Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
	Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
	Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
	To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
	My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
	Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

<COUNTESS>	<81%>
	I would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love.

<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
<COUNTESS>	<83%>
	So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him: by his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
