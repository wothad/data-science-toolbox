	And you.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<85%>
	I have been sometimes there.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<85%>
	What's your will?

	The king's not here.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<85%>
	Not, indeed:
	He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
	Than is his use.

<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>

	Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<89%>
	I shall, my liege.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<92%>
	Gracious sovereign,
	Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
	Here's a petition from a Florentine,
	Who hath, for four or five removes come short
	To tender it herself. I undertook it,
	Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
	Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
	Is here attending: her business looks in her
	With an importing visage, and she told me,
	In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
	Your highness with herself.
</GENTLEMAN>
