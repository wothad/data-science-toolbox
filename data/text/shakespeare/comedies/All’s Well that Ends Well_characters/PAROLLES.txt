	Save you, fair queen!

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	No.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Are you meditating on virginity?
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Keep him out.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<PAROLLES>	<4%>
	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found: by being ever kept, it is ever lost.'Tis too cold a companion: away with't!
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<PAROLLES>	<5%>
	There's little can be said in't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't! Out with't! within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with't!
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<PAROLLES>	<5%>
	Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with't, while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion; richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek: and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it?

	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.

	My life, sir, in any case! not that I am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.

	He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus; he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules; he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool; drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.

<SPEECH 118><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>

	Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie him I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not; except, in that country, he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.

	Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.

	E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he out-runs any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.

<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

	Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great
	'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
	But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
	As captain shall: simply the thing I am
	Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
	Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
	That every braggart shall be found an ass.
	Rust, sword! cool, blushes! and Parolles, live
	Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
	There's place and means for every man alive.
	I'll after them.

	Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
<PAROLLES>	<86%>
	Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir: I spake but by a metaphor.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
<PAROLLES>	<86%>
	Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

	My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratched.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 130><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
<PAROLLES>	<87%>
	I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>

	My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>

	O, my good lord! you were the first that found me.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
<PAROLLES>	<87%>
	It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 134><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
<PAROLLES>	<88%>
	I praise God for you.

	So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.

	Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 137><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>

	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>

	He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 139><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>

	I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

	Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
</PAROLLES>

<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PAROLLES>	<97%>
	Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for, indeed, he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time, that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of: therefore I will not speak what I know.
