	Happy is your Grace,
	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
	Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

	Under the greenwood tree
	Who loves to lie with me,
	And turn his merry note
	Unto the sweet bird's throat,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see
	No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.
</AMIENS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 5><31%>

	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
</AMIENS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 5><32%>
<AMIENS>	<32%>
	My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
</AMIENS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 5><32%>
<AMIENS>	<32%>
	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
</AMIENS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 5><32%>
<AMIENS>	<33%>
	More at your request than to please myself.

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 5><32%>
<AMIENS>	<33%>
	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.

	Who doth ambition shun,
<STAGE DIR>
<All together here.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And loves to live i' the sun,
	Secking the food he eats,
	And pleas'd with what he gets.
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see
	No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.
</AMIENS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 5><33%>

	Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
	Thou art not so unkind
	    As man's ingratitude;
	Thy tooth is not so keen,
	Because thou art not seen,
	    Although thy breath be rude.
	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
	Then heigh-ho! the holly!
	    This life is most jolly.
	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
	That dost not bite so nigh
	    As benefits forgot:
	Though thou the waters warp,
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	    As friend remember'd not.
	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
	    Then heigh-ho! the holly!
	      This life is most jolly.
</AMIENS>
