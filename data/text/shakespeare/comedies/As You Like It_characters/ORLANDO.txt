	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me, his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>

	Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should come to such penury?

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<ORLANDO>	<2%>
	O! sir, very well: here in your orchard.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<ORLANDO>	<2%>
	Ay, better than he I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>

	I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<ORLANDO>	<3%>
	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education: you have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.

<ORLANDO>	<13%>
	I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.

</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
<ORLANDO>	<27%>
	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
<ORLANDO>	<27%>
	What! wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	A thievish living on the common road?
	This I must do, or know not what to do:
	Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
	I rather will subject me to the malice
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
<ORLANDO>	<27%>
	O good old man! how well in thee appears
	The constant service of the antique world,
	When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
	Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
	Where none will sweat but for promotion,
	And having that, do choke their service up
	Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
	But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree,
	That cannot so much as a blossom yield,
	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
	But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
	We'll light upon some settled low content.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
<ORLANDO>	<34%>
	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it, or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake be comfortable, hold death awhile at the arm's end, I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said! thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come I will bear thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<ORLANDO>	<38%>
	Forbear, and eat no more.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<ORLANDO>	<38%>
	Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.

<ORLANDO>	<38%>
	You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
	Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show

	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
	He dies that touches any of this fruit
	Till I and my affairs are answered.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
<ORLANDO>	<38%>
	I almost die for food; and let me have it.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
<ORLANDO>	<38%>
	Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
	I thought that all things had been savage here,
	And therefore put I on the countenance
	Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
	That in this desert inaccessible,
	Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
	If ever you have look'd on better days,
	If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
	If ever sat at any good man's feast,
	If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
	And know what 'tis to pity, and be pitied,
	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
	In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 7><38%>
<ORLANDO>	<39%>
	Then but forbear your food a little while,
	Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
	And give it food. There is an old poor man,
	Who after me hath many a weary step
	Limp'd in pure love: till he be first suffic'd,
	Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
	I will not touch a bit.
</ORLANDO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 7><39%>
<ORLANDO>	<39%>

	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
	And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey

	Thy huntress' name, that my full life doth sway.
	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
	And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
	That every eye, which in this forest looks,
	Shall see thy virtue witness'd everywhere.
	Run, run, Orlando: carve on every tree
	The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.

	My lord, the first time that I ever saw him,
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter;
	But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,

	Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
	Whom he reports to be a great magician,
	Obscured in the circle of this forest.
