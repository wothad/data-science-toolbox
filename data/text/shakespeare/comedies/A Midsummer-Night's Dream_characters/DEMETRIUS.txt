	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.

	Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood;

	Hence! get thee gone, and follow me no more.

	You do impeach your modesty too much,

	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow,
	This pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,
	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow

	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:

	There to remain.

	Nay then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,

	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
	Of this their purpose hither, to this wood;
	And I in fury hither follow'd them,
	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,—
	But by some power it is,—my love to Hermia,
	Melted as doth the snow, seems to me now
	As the remembrance of an idle gaud
	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
	But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
	Now do I wish it, love it, long for it,
	And will for evermore be true to it.

	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
	And such a wall, as I would have you think,
	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
	Did whisper often very secretly.
	This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth show
	That I am that same wall; the truth is so;
	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
