	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
	Of our solemnities.

	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
	Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,
	The skies, the fountains, every region near
	Seem'd all one mutual cry. I never heard
	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

	But all the story of the night told over,
	And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
	More witnesseth than fancy's images,
	And grows to something of great constancy,
	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

	I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharg'd,

	Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
