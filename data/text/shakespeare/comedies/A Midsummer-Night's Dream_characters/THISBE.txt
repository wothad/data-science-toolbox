	O wall! full often hast thou heard my moans,
	For parting my fair Pyramus and me:
	My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
	Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

	Asleep, my love?
	What, dead, my dove?
	O Pyramus, arise!
	Speak, speak! Quite dumb?
	Dead, dead! A tomb
	Must cover thy sweet eyes.
	These lily lips,
	This cherry nose,
	These yellow cowslip cheeks,
	Are gone, are gone:
	Lovers, make moan!
	His eyes were green as leeks.
	O, Sisters Three,
	Come, come to me,
	With hands as pale as milk;
	Lay them in gore,
	Since you have shore
	With shears his thread of silk.
	Tongue, not a word:
	Come, trusty sword:
	Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
<STAGE DIR>
<Stabs herself.>
</STAGE DIR>
	And farewell, friends;
	Thus Thisby ends:
	Adieu, adieu, adieu.
<STAGE DIR>
<Dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
