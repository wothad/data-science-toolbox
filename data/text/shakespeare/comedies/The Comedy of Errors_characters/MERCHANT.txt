	Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
	Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
	This very day, a Syracusian merchant
	Is apprehended for arrival here;
	And, not being able to buy out his life,
	According to the statute of the town
	Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
	There is your money that I had to keep.

	I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
	Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
	I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
	Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
	And afterward consort you till bed-time:
	My present business calls me from you now.
</MERCHANT>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<MERCHANT>	<10%>
	Sir, I commend you to your own content.

	You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
	And since I have not much importun'd you;
	Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
	To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
	Therefore make present satisfaction,
	Or I'll attach you by this officer.

	My business cannot brook this dalliance.
	Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no:
	If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
</MERCHANT>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
<MERCHANT>	<55%>
	Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

	Speak softly: yonder, as I think, he walks.

</MERCHANT>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<MERCHANT>	<78%>
	Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
</MERCHANT>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<MERCHANT>	<78%>
	These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
	Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
