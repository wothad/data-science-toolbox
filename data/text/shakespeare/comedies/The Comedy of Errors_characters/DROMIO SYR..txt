<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><19%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<21%>
	What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<21%>
	I did not see you since you sent me hence,

</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<22%>
	I am glad to see you in this merry vein:

</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<22%>
	Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest.
	Upon what bargain do you give it me?
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<23%>
	Sconce, call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But, I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<23%>
	Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<23%>
	Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<23%>
	Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,

</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>

	No, sir: I think the meat wants that I have

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>

	Basting.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>

</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>

	Certain ones, then.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<26%>
	The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<26%>
	Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<26%>
	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.

	O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.

<DROMIO SYR.>	<45%>
	Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<46%>
	A very reverent body; aye, such a one as a man may not speak of, without he say, 'Sir-reverence.' I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<DROMIO SYR.>	<46%>
	Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench, and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter; if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<47%>
	No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<47%>
	Marry, sir, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<47%>
	I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.

<DROMIO SYR.>	<48%>
	O, sir! upon her nose, all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<48%>
	O, sir! I did not look so low. To conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me; call'd me Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch.
	And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel,
	She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel.
</DROMIO SYR.>

	Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
	That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
	And then she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
	I have convey'd aboard, and I have bought

	The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
	Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at all
	But for their owner, master, and yourself.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 4><SCENE 1><56%>

	To Adriana! that is where we din'd,

	No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
	A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,
	One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
	A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
	A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
	A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
	The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
	A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
	One that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell.
</DROMIO SYR.>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 4><SCENE 2><59%>

	No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a base-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a fob, and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

	Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God give you good rest!'

	Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.

<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
<DROMIO SYR.>	<64%>
	Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof comes that the wenches say, 'God damn me;' that's as much as to say, 'God make me a light wench.' It is written, they appear to men like angels of light: light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
