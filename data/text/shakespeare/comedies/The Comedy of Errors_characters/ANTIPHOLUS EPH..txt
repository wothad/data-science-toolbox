	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
	My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours;
	Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
	To see the making of her carkanet,
	And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
	But here's a villain, that would face me down
	He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
	And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
	And that I did deny my wife and house.
	Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<33%>
	I think thou art an ass.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<33%>
	You are sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God, our cheer
	May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<33%>
	O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
	A table-full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<34%>
	And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><32%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<34%>
	Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:
	But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
	Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
	But soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><33%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<35%>
	Who talks within there? ho! open the door.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><34%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<35%>
	Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not din'd to-day.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><34%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<35%>
	What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><35%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<36%>
	Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I trow?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><35%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<36%>
	Thou baggage, let me in.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><36%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<37%>
	You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><36%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<37%>
	Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<38%>
	There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<38%>
	Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<39%>
	Well, I'll break in. Go borrow me a crow.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><38%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<39%>
	Go get thee gone: fetch me an iron crow.

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><39%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<40%>
	You have prevail'd: I will depart in quiet,
	And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
	I know a wench of excellent discourse,
	Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle:
	There will we dine: this woman that I mean,
	My wife,—but, I protest, without desert,—
	Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
	To her will we to dinner. <STAGE DIR>
<To Angelo.>
</STAGE DIR> Get you home,
	And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
	Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
	For there's the house: that chain will I bestow,
	Be it for nothing but to spite my wife,
	Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.
	Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
	I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<41%>
	Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><51%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<52%>
	While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
	And buy a rope's end, that I will bestow
	Among my wife and her confederates,
	For locking me out of my doors by day.
	But soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
	Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><51%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<52%>
	A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
	I promised your presence and the chain;
	But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
	Belike you thought our love would last too long,
	If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><52%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<53%>
	I am not furnish'd with the present money;
	Besides, I have some business in the town.
	Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
	And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
	Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
	Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><52%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<53%>
	No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><52%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<53%>
	An if I have not, sir, I hope you have,

</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<54%>
	Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
	Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
	I should have child you for not bringing it,
	But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<54%>
	Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<54%>
	Fie! now you run this humour out of breath.
	Come, where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><53%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<54%>
	I answer you! what should I answer you?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<55%>
	I owe you none till I receive the chain.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<55%>
	You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><54%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<55%>
	Consent to pay thee that I never had!

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<55%>
	I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
	But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
	As all the metal in your shop will answer.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<56%>
	How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
	What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><55%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<56%>
	Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
	And told thee to what purpose, and what end.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><56%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<57%>
	I will debate this matter at more leisure,
	And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
	To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
	Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
	That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
	There is a purse of ducats: let her send it.
	Tell her I am arrested in the street,
	And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave, be gone!
	On, officer, to prison till it come.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><66%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<67%>
	Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
	I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
	To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
	My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
	And will not lightly trust the messenger.
	That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
	I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope's end.>

	Here comes my man: I think he brings the money.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><67%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	But where's the money?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 4><67%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 4><67%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 4><67%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<68%>
	Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<70%>
	You minion, you, are these your customers?
	Did this companion with the saffron face
	Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
	Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
	And I denied to enter in my house?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<71%>
	Din'd at home! Thou villain, what say'st thou?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<71%>
	Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><70%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<71%>
	And did not she herself revile me there?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<71%>
	Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<71%>
	And did not I in rage depart from thence?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<72%>
	Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>

	Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<72%>
	Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?

<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<73%>
	Dissembling harlot! thou art false in all;
	And art confederate with a damned pack

<SPEECH 60><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<87%>
	Justice, most gracious duke! O! grant me justice,
	Even for the service that long since I did thee,
	When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
	Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
	That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<88%>
	Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
	She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
	That hath abused and dishonour'd me,
	Even in the strength and height of injury!
	Beyond imagination is the wrong
	That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<88%>
	This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
	While she with harlots feasted in my house.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<88%>
	My liege, I am advised what I say:
	Neither disturb'd with the effect of wine,
	Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
	Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
	This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
	That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
	Could witness it, for he was with me then;
	Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
	Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
	Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
	Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
	I went to seek him: in the street I met him,
	And in his company that gentleman.
	There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
	That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
	Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
	He did arrest me with an officer.
	I did obey, and sent my peasant home
	For certain ducats: he with none return'd.
	Then fairly I bespoke the officer
	To go in person with me to my house.
	By the way we met
	My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
	Of vile confederates: along with them
	They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
	A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
	A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
	A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
	A living-dead man. This pernicious slave,
	Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
	And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
	And with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,
	Cries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether
	They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
	And in a dark and dankish vault at home
	There left me and my man, both bound together;
	Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
	I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
	Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
	To give me ample satisfaction
	For these deep shames and great indignities.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<91%>
	I never came within these abbey walls;
	Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
	I never saw the chain, so help me heaven!
	And this is false you burden me withal.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<92%>
	'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<93%>
	I never saw you in my life till now.

<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<94%>
	The duke and all that know me in the city
	Can witness with me that it is not so:

</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>	<96%>
	I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,—
