	Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
	And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
	Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
	A man is master of his liberty:
	Time is their master, and, when they see time,
	They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><13%>
<LUCE>	<15%>
	Because their business still lies out o' door.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><13%>
<LUCE>	<15%>
	O! know he is the bridle of your will.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><13%>
<LUCE>	<15%>
	Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
	There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
	But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
	The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
	Are their males' subjects and at their controls.
	Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
	Lords of the wide world, and wild wat'ry seas,
	Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
	Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
	Are masters to their females and their lords:
	Then, let your will attend on their accords.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><14%>

	Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><14%>

	Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

	Till he come home again, I would forbear.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><15%>
<LUCE>	<17%>
	Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
	Here comes your man: now is your husband nigh.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><15%>
<LUCE>	<17%>
	Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><16%>
<LUCE>	<18%>
	Quoth who?
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>

	Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>

	Fie, brother: how the world is chang'd with you!
	When were you wont to use my sister thus?
	She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>

	Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<LUCE>	<30%>
	Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not?
	Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<LUCE>	<31%>
	If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><35%>

</STAGE DIR> I thought to have ask'd you.

	And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
	Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
	Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
	If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
	Then, for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
	Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
	Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
	Let not my sister read it in your eye;
	Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
	Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
	Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
	Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
	Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
	Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
	What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
	'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,
	And let her read it in thy looks at board:
	Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
	Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
	Alas! poor women, make us but believe,
	Being compact of credit, that you love us;
	Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
	We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
	Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
	Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
	'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
	When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
<LUCE>	<44%>
	What! are you mad, that you do reason so?
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
<LUCE>	<44%>
	It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><42%>
<LUCE>	<44%>
	Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
<LUCE>	<44%>
	Why call you me love? call my sister so.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
<LUCE>	<44%>
	That's my sister.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>

	All this my sister is, or else should be.
</LUCE>

	First he denied you had in him no right.

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 2><57%>
<LUCE>	<58%>
	Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 2><57%>
<LUCE>	<58%>
	Then pleaded I for you.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 2><57%>
<LUCE>	<58%>
	That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 2><57%>
<LUCE>	<58%>
	With words that in an honest suit might move.
	First, he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 2><58%>
<LUCE>	<58%>
	Have patience, I beseech.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 2><58%>
<LUCE>	<59%>
	Who would be jealous then, of such a one?
	No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

	Alas! how fiery and how sharp he looks.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
<LUCE>	<72%>
	And I am witness with her that she did.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
<LUCE>	<73%>
	Ay me! poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>

	God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<LUCE>	<81%>
	She never reprehended him but mildly
	When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
	Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCE>	<83%>
	Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
</LUCE>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>

	Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

	Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
	But she tells to your highness simple truth!
