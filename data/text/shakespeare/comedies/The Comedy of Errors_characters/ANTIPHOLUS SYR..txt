	The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
	Against my soul's pure truth why labour you

	Are you a god? would you create me new?
	Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
	But if that I am I, then well I know
	Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
	Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:
	Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
	O! train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
	To drown me in thy sister flood of tears:
	Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote:
	Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
	And as a bed I'll take them and there lie;

	Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
	Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
