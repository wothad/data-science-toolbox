	His company must do his minions grace,

	Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
	From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it:
	Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
	If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
	Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
	Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
	That's not my fault; he's master of my state:
	What ruins are in me that can be found
	By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
	Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
	A sunny look of his would soon repair;

	So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
	I see, the jewel best enamelled
	Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still
	That others touch, yet often touching will
	Wear gold; and no man that hath a name,
	By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
	Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,

	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:
	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,
	I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
	The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
	That never words were music to thine ear,
	That never object pleasing in thine eye,
	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
	That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
	How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it,
	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
	That, undividable, incorporate,
	Am better than thy dear self's better part.
	Ah! do not tear away thyself from me,
	For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
	And take unmingled thence that drop again,
	Without addition or diminishing,
	As take from me thyself and not me too.
	How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,
	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
	And hurl the name of husband in my face,
	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
	I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.
	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
	For if we two be one and thou play false,
	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
	Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

	How ill agrees it with your gravity

	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

	I cannot, nor I will not hold me still:

	May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,

	At your important letters, this ill day
	A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
	That desperately he hurried through the street,—
	With him his bondman, all as mad as he,—
	Doing displeasure to the citizens
	By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
	Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
	Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
	Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
	That here and there his fury had committed.
	Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
	He broke from those that had the guard of him,
	And with his mad attendant and himself,
	Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords
	Met us again, and, madly bent on us
	Chas'd us away, till, raising of more aid
	We came again to bind them. Then they fled
	Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
	And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
	And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
	Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
	Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
	Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.
