	Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
	Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me

</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
<LUCIO>	<13%>
	Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
	Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
<LUCIO>	<13%>
	For that which, if myself might be his judge,
	He should receive his punishment in thanks:
	He hath got his friend with child.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LUCIO>	<13%>
	It is true.
	I would not, though 'tis my familiar sin
	With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
	Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so:
	I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted;
	By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
	And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
	As with a saint.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LUCIO>	<13%>
	Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
	Your brother and his lover have embrac'd:
	As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
	That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
	To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
	Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LUCIO>	<14%>
	Is she your cousin?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LUCIO>	<14%>
	She it is.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LUCIO>	<14%>
	This is the point.
	The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
	Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
	In hand and hope of action; but we do learn
	By those that know the very nerves of state,
	His givings out were of an infinite distance
	From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
	And with full line of his authority,
	Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
	Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
	The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
	But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
	With profits of the mind, study and fast.
	He,—to give fear to use and liberty,
	Which have for long run by the hideous law,
	As mice by lions, hath pick'd out an act,
	Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
	Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it,
	And follows close the rigour of the statute,
	To make him an example. All hope is gone,
	Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
	To soften Angelo; and that's my pith of business
	Twixt you and your poor brother.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
<LUCIO>	<14%>
	He's censur'd him
	Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
	A warrant for his execution.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>

	Our doubts are traitors,
	And make us lose the good we oft might win,
	By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
	And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
	Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
	All their petitions are as freely theirs
	As they themselves would owe them.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>

</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<LUCIO>	<53%>
	Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go, say I sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<LUCIO>	<53%>
	Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he, doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house.

	What news, friar, of the duke?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation: is it true, think you?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice; that I know to be true; and he is a motion generative; that's infallible.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<LUCIO>	<54%>
	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a cod-piece to take away the life of a man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<LUCIO>	<55%>
	O, sir, you are deceived.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<LUCIO>	<55%>
	Who? not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty, and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish; the duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<LUCIO>	<55%>
	Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the duke; and, I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<LUCIO>	<55%>
	No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips; but this I can let you understand, the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<LUCIO>	<55%>
	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>

	Sir, I know him, and I love him.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Come, sir, I know what I know.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the duke.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<LUCIO>	<56%>
	I fear you not.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<LUCIO>	<56%>
	I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<LUCIO>	<56%>
	Why? for filling a bottle with a tundish. I would the duke we talk of were returned again: this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to light: would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee, pray for me. The duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
<LUCIO>	<76%>
	Good even. Friar, where is the provost?
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the duke will be here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother: if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do: he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee: I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 81><ACT 4><SCENE 3><77%>
<LUCIO>	<77%>
	By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIO>	<83%>
	That's I, an't like your Grace:
	I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her
	To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
	For her poor brother's pardon.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIO>	<83%>
	No, my good lord;
	Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIO>	<83%>
	I warrant your honour.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIO>	<84%>
	Right.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<LUCIO>	<85%>
	My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
	I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord,
	For certain words he spake against your Grace
	In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.
</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<LUCIO>	<85%>
	But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,

</LUCIO>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<LUCIO>	<86%>
	My lord, most villanously; believe it.
