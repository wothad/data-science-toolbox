	I have a brother is condemn'd to die:

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
<ISABELLA>	<27%>

	Must he needs die?
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
<ISABELLA>	<27%>
	Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
	And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
<ISABELLA>	<27%>
	But can you, if you would?
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><27%>
<ISABELLA>	<27%>
	But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<ISABELLA>	<28%>
	Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word,
	May call it back again. Well, believe this,
	No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
	Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
	The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
	Become them with one half so good a grace
	As mercy does.
	If he had been as you, and you as he,
	You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
	Would not have been so stern.

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<ISABELLA>	<28%>
	I would to heaven I had your potency,

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<ISABELLA>	<28%>
	Alas! alas!
	Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
	And He that might the vantage best have took,
	Found out the remedy. How would you be,
	If He, which is the top of judgment, should
	But judge you as you are? O! think on that,
	And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
	Like man new made.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<ISABELLA>	<28%>
	To-morrow! O! that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
	He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
	We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
	With less respect than we do minister
	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you:
	Who is it that hath died for this offence?
	There's many have committed it.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<ISABELLA>	<29%>
	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
	And he that suffers. O! it is excellent
	To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous

<ISABELLA>	<30%>
	Could great men thunder
	As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,

	Merciful heaven!
	Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
	Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
	Than the soft myrtle; but man, proud man,
	Drest in a little brief authority,
	Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
	His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
	Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
	As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
	Would all themselves laugh mortal.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<ISABELLA>	<30%>
	We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
	Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<ISABELLA>	<30%>
	That in the captain's but a choleric word,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<ISABELLA>	<30%>
	Because authority, though it err like others,
	Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
	That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
	Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
	That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
	A natural guiltiness such as is his,
	Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
	Against my brother's life.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>

	Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>

	When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<ISABELLA>	<36%>
	How say you?
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<ISABELLA>	<36%>
	Please you to do't,
	I'll take it as a peril to my soul;
	It is no sin at all, but charity.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<ISABELLA>	<37%>
	That I do beg his life, if it be sin,

	And nothing of your answer.

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<ISABELLA>	<37%>
	Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<ISABELLA>	<37%>
	So.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<ISABELLA>	<37%>
	True.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	As much for my poor brother, as myself:
	That is, were I under the terms of death,
	Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
	And strip myself to death, as to a bed
	That, longing, have been sick for, ere I'd yield
	My body up to shame.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	And 'twere the cheaper way:
	Better it were a brother died at once,
	Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
	Should die for ever.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	Ignomy in ransom and free pardon

<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	O, pardon me, my lord! it oft falls out,
	To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.
	I something do excuse the thing I hate,
	For his advantage that I dearly love.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	Else let my brother die,
	If not a feodary, but only he

<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
<ISABELLA>	<38%>
	Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,

	Women! Help heaven! men their creation mar

	And credulous to false prints.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
<ISABELLA>	<39%>
	I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
<ISABELLA>	<39%>
	My brother did love Juliet; and you tell me
	That he shall die for't.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
<ISABELLA>	<39%>
	I know your virtue hath a licence in't.

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 2><SCENE 4><39%>
<ISABELLA>	<39%>
	Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
	And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
	I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
	Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
	Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
	What man thou art.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
<ISABELLA>	<40%>
	To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
	Who would believe me? O perilous mouths!
	That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
	Either of condemnation or approof,
	Bidding the law make curt'sy to their will;
	Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
	To follow as it draws. I'll to my brother:
	Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
	Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour,
	That, had he twenty heads to tender down
	On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up,
	Before his sister should her body stoop
	To such abhorr'd pollution.
	Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
	More than our brother is our chastity.
	I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
	And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<ISABELLA>	<44%>
	There spake my brother: there my father's grave

	Thou art too noble to conserve a life
	In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
	Whose settled visage and deliberate word
	Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth enmew
	As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;

	Little have you to say
	When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
	'Remember now my brother.'
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 101><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Within.>
</STAGE DIR> Peace, ho, be here!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
	Ho! by your leave.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
	The better, given me by so holy a man.
	Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
	Nay, but it is not so.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
	O! I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 3><75%>
<ISABELLA>	<75%>
	Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
	Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 3><76%>
<ISABELLA>	<76%>
	I am directed by you.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<ISABELLA>	<80%>
	To speak so indirectly I am loath:
	I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
	That is your part: yet I'm advis'd to do it;
	He says, to veil full purpose.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<ISABELLA>	<80%>
	Besides, he tells me that if peradventure
	He speak against me on the adverse side,
	I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
	That's bitter to sweet end.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<ISABELLA>	<80%>
	O, peace! the friar is come.

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ISABELLA>	<81%>
	Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
	Upon a wrong'd, I'd fain have said, a maid!
	O worthy prince! dishonour not your eye
	By throwing it on any other object
	Till you have heard me in my true complaint
	And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	O worthy duke!
	You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
	Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
	Must either punish me, not being believ'd,
	Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	By course of justice!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
	That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
	That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
	A hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
	Is it not strange, and strange?
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	It is not truer he is Angelo
	Than this is all as true as it is strange;
	Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
	To the end of reckoning.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<ISABELLA>	<82%>
	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
	There is another comfort than this world,
	That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
	That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
	That which but seems unlike. 'Tis not impossible
	But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
	As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
	In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
	Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince:
	If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
	Had I more name for badness.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	O gracious duke!
	Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
	For inequality; but let your reason serve
	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
	And hide the false seems true.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	I am the sister of one Claudio,
	Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
	To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
	I, in probation of a sisterhood,
	Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
	As then the messenger,—
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<83%>
	That's he indeed.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,—
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	I went
	To this pernicious caitiff deputy.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	Pardon it;
	The phrase is to the matter.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 123><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	In brief, to set the needless process by,
	How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
	How he refell'd me, and how I replied,—
	For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion
	I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
	Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
	And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
	For my poor brother's head.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<ISABELLA>	<84%>
	O, that it were as like as it is true!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 125><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<ISABELLA>	<85%>
	And is this all?
	Then, O you blessed ministers above,
	Keep me in patience; and, with ripen'd time
	Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
	In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
	As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 126><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<ISABELLA>	<85%>
	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<ISABELLA>	<94%>
	O, give me pardon,
	That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
	Your unknown sovereignty!
</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 128><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<ISABELLA>	<95%>
	I do, my lord.

</ISABELLA>

<SPEECH 129><ACT 5><SCENE 1><96%>
<ISABELLA>	<96%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneeling.>
</STAGE DIR> Most bounteous sir,
	Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
	As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
	A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
	Till he did look on me: since it is so,
	Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
	In that he did the thing for which he died:
	For Angelo,
	His act did not o'ertake his bad intent;
	And must be buried but as an intent
	That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
	Intents but merely thoughts.
</ISABELLA>
