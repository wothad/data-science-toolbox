<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<ESCALUS>	<1%>
	If any in Vienna be of worth
	To undergo such ample grace and honour,
	It is Lord Angelo.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
	To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
	To look into the bottom of my place:
	A power I have, but of what strength and nature
	I am not yet instructed.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<ESCALUS>	<3%>
	I'll wait upon your honour.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><15%>
<ESCALUS>	<15%>
	Ay, but yet
	Let us be keen and rather cut a little,
	Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman,
	Whom I would save, had a most noble father.
	Let but your honour know,—
	Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,—
	That, in the working of your own affections,
	Had time coher'd with place or place with wishing,
	Or that the resolute acting of your blood
	Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
	Whether you had not, some time in your life,
	Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
	And pull'd the law upon you.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><16%>
<ESCALUS>	<16%>
	Be it as your wisdom will.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><16%>
<ESCALUS>	<17%>
	Well, heaven forgive him, and forgive us all!
	Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
	Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none,
	And some condemned for a fault alone.

</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
<ESCALUS>	<17%>
	This comes off well: here's a wise officer.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	How know you that?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	How! thy wife?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	Dost thou detest her therefore?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><17%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	How dost thou know that, constable?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
	By the woman's means?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<ESCALUS>	<18%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Angelo.>
</STAGE DIR> Do you hear how he misplaces?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<ESCALUS>	<19%>
	Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<ESCALUS>	<19%>
	Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<ESCALUS>	<19%>
	No, sir, nor I mean it not.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Angelo.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Ay, sir, very well.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<20%>
	Well, I do so.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	Why, no.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	Which is the wiser here? Justice, or Iniquity? Is this true?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<ESCALUS>	<21%>
	If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your action of slander too.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldest discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Where were you born, friend?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	So. <STAGE DIR>
<To Pompey.>
</STAGE DIR> What trade are you of, sir?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Your mistress' name?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Hath she had any more than one husband?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Nine!—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<22%>
	Well: no more of it, Master Froth: farewell. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Froth.>
</STAGE DIR>—Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your name, Master tapster?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	What else?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you, so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	No, Pompey.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: it is but heading and hanging.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<ESCALUS>	<23%>
	Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Cæsar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt. So, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<24%>
	Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<24%>
	I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<24%>
	Alas! it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong to put you so oft upon 't. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<24%>
	Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<25%>
	To my house. Fare you well.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Elbow.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What's o'clock, think you?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<ESCALUS>	<25%>
	I pray you home to dinner with me.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<ESCALUS>	<25%>
	It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
	But there is no remedy.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<ESCALUS>	<25%>
	It is but needful:
	Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
	Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
	But yet, poor Claudio! There's no remedy.
	Come, sir.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<ESCALUS>	<57%>
	Go; away with her to prison!
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<ESCALUS>	<57%>
	Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind? This would make mercy swear, and play the tyrant.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<ESCALUS>	<58%>
	That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to; no more words. <STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Officers with Mistress Overdone.>
</STAGE DIR> Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; Claudio must die to-morrow. Let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable preparation: if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<ESCALUS>	<58%>
	Good even, good father.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<ESCALUS>	<58%>
	Of whence are you?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<ESCALUS>	<58%>
	What news abroad i' the world?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice: a gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to understand, that you have lent him visitation.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother justice have I found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
<ESCALUS>	<59%>
	I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
<ESCALUS>	<78%>
	Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<ESCALUS>	<78%>
	I guess not.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<ESCALUS>	<78%>
	He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of complaints, and to deliver us from devices hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand against us.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<ESCALUS>	<78%>
	I shall, sir: fare you well.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>

	Happy return be to your royal Grace!

	Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
	Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<ESCALUS>	<90%>
	We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<90%>
	Call that same Isabel here once again:
	I would speak with her. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I'll handle her.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<90%>
	Say you?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<90%>
	I will go darkly to work with her.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<90%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To Isab.>
</STAGE DIR> Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<91%>
	In very good time: speak not you to him, till we call upon you.

</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<91%>
	Come, sir. Did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 1><90%>
<ESCALUS>	<91%>
	How! know you where you are?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<ESCALUS>	<91%>
	The duke's in us, and we will hear you speak:
	Look you speak justly.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<ESCALUS>	<91%>
	Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar!
	Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
	To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
	And in the witness of his proper ear,
	To call him villain?
	And then to glance from him to the duke himself.
	To tax him with injustice? take him hence;
	To the rack with him! We'll touse you joint by joint,
	But we will know his purpose. What! 'unjust'?
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ESCALUS>	<92%>
	Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<ESCALUS>	<93%>
	Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal.
	Away with him to prison! Where is the provost?
	Away with him to prison! Lay bolts enough on him, let him speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and with the other confederate companion!
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<ESCALUS>	<94%>
	My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour
	Than at the strangeness of it.
</ESCALUS>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 1><97%>
<ESCALUS>	<97%>
	I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
	As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
	Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood,
	And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
</ESCALUS>
