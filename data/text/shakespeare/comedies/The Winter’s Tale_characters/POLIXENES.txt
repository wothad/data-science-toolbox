	Nine changes of the watery star have been
	The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
	Without a burden: time as long again
	Would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
	And yet we should for perpetuity
	Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
	Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
	With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
	That go before it.

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<POLIXENES>	<2%>
	Sir, that's to-morrow.
	I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
	Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
	No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,
	'This is put forth too truly!' Besides, I have stay'd
	To tire your royalty.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<POLIXENES>	<2%>
	No longer stay.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<POLIXENES>	<2%>
	Very sooth, to-morrow.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<POLIXENES>	<3%>
	Press me not, beseech you, so.
	There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
	So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
	Were there necessity in your request, although
	'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
	Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder
	Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
	To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
	Farewell, our brother.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<POLIXENES>	<3%>
	No, madam.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<POLIXENES>	<3%>
	I may not, verily.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<POLIXENES>	<4%>
	Your guest, then, madam:
	To be your prisoner should import offending;
	Which is for me less easy to commit
	Than you to punish.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
<POLIXENES>	<4%>
	We were, fair queen,
	Two lads that thought there was no more behind
	But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
	And to be boy eternal.

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
<POLIXENES>	<4%>
	We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
	And bleat the one at the other: what we chang'd
	Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
	The doctrine of ill-doing, no nor dream'd
	That any did. Had we pursu'd that life,
	And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
	With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
	Boldly, 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
	Hereditary ours.

	O! my most sacred lady,
	Temptations have since then been born to's; for
	In those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl;
	Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
	Of my young playfellow.
</POLIXENES>

</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>

<POLIXENES>	<7%>
	If at home, sir,
	He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
	Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy;
	My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
	He makes a July's day short as December,
	And with his varying childness cures in me
	Thoughts that would thick my blood.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<POLIXENES>	<14%>
	This is strange: methinks

	Good day, Camillo.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<POLIXENES>	<14%>
	What is the news i' the court?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<POLIXENES>	<14%>
	The king hath on him such a countenance
	As he had lost some province and a region
	Lov'd as he loves himself: even now I met him
	With customary compliment, when he,
	Wafting his eyes, to the contrary, and falling
	A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
	So leaves me to consider what is breeding
	That changes thus his manners.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<POLIXENES>	<14%>
	How! dare not! do not! Do you know, and dare not
	Be intelligent to me? 'Tis thereabouts:
	For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,
	And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
	Your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror
	Which shows me mine chang'd too; for I must be
	A party in this alteration, finding
	Myself thus alter'd with't.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	How! caught of me?
	Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
	I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
	By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,—
	As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
	Clerk-like experienc'd, which no less adorns
	Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
	In whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you,
	If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
	Thereof to be inform'd, imprison it not
	In ignorant concealment.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
	I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo;
	I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
	Which honour does acknowledge,—whereof the least
	Is not this suit of mine,—that thou declare
	What incidency thou dost guess of harm
	Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
	Which way to be prevented if to be;
	If not, how best to bear it.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	On, good Camillo.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	By whom, Camillo?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	For what?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<POLIXENES>	<15%>
	O, then my best blood turn
	To an infected jelly, and my name
	Be yok'd with his that did betray the Best!
	Turn then my freshest reputation to
	A savour, that may strike the dullest nostril
	Where I arrive; and my approach be shunn'd,
	Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
	That e'er was heard or read!
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
<POLIXENES>	<16%>
	How should this grow?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
<POLIXENES>	<16%>
	I do believe thee:
	I saw his heart in's face. Give me thy hand:
	Be pilot to me and thy places shall
	Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
	My people did expect my hence departure
	Two days ago. This jealousy
	Is for a precious creature: as she's rare
	Must it be great, and, as his person's mighty
	Must it be violent, and, as he does conceive
	He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
	Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
	In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
	Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
	The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
	Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come. Camillo;
	I will respect thee as a father if
	Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><47%>
<POLIXENES>	<48%>
	I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: 'tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><47%>
<POLIXENES>	<48%>
	As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made: better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough considered,—as too much I cannot,—to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein, the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><48%>
<POLIXENES>	<49%>
	I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far, that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><48%>
<POLIXENES>	<49%>
	That's likewise part of my intelligence; but I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><48%>
<POLIXENES>	<49%>
	My best Camillo!—We must disguise ourselves.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
<POLIXENES>	<56%>
	Shepherdess,—
	A fair one are you,—well you fit our ages
	With flowers of winter.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
<POLIXENES>	<56%>
	Wherefore, gentle maiden,
	Do you neglect them?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><55%>
<POLIXENES>	<56%>
	Say there be;
	Yet nature is made better by no mean
	But nature makes that mean: so, over that art,
	Which you say adds to nature, is an art
	That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
	A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
	And make conceive a bark of baser kind
	By bud of nobler race: this is an art
	Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
	The art itself is nature.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><56%>
<POLIXENES>	<57%>
	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
	And do not call them bastards.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 3><57%>
<POLIXENES>	<58%>
	This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
	Ran on the green-sord: nothing she does or seems
	But smacks of something greater than herself;
	Too noble for this place.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 3><58%>
<POLIXENES>	<59%>
	Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
	Which dances with your daughter?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 3><58%>

	She dances featly.

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 3><59%>

<To Shep.>
</STAGE DIR> O, father! you'll know more of that hereafter.

<To Camillo.>
</STAGE DIR> Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
	He's simple and tells much. <STAGE DIR>
<To Florizel.>
</STAGE DIR> How now, fair shepherd!
	Your heart is full of something that does take
	Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young,
	And handed love as you do, I was wont
	To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
	The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
	To her acceptance; you have let him go
	And nothing marted with him. If your lass
	Interpretation should abuse and call this
	Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
	For a reply, at least if you make a care
	Of happy holding her.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 3><64%>
<POLIXENES>	<65%>
	What follows this?
	How prettily the young swain seems to wash
	The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
	But to your protestation: let me hear
	What you profess.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
<POLIXENES>	<65%>
	And this my neighbour too?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
<POLIXENES>	<66%>
	Fairly offer'd.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
<POLIXENES>	<66%>
	Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you.
	Have you a father?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 3><65%>
<POLIXENES>	<66%>
	Knows he of this?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<POLIXENES>	<66%>
	Methinks a father
	Is, at the nuptial of his son, a guest
	That best becomes the table. Pray you, once more,
	Is not your father grown incapable
	Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
	With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
	Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
	Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
	But what he did being childish?
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<POLIXENES>	<66%>
	By my white beard,
	You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
	Something unfilial. Reason my son
	Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
	The father,—all whose joy is nothing else
	But fair posterity,—should hold some counsel
	In such a business.
</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<POLIXENES>	<67%>
	Let him know't.

</POLIXENES>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 3><67%>
<POLIXENES>	<67%>
	I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
	More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
	If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
	That thou no more shalt see this knack,—as never
	I mean thou shalt,—we'll bar thee from succession;
	Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
	Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
	Follow us to the court. Thou, churl, for this time,
	Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
	From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,—
	Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too,
	That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
	Unworthy thee,—if ever henceforth thou
	These rural latches to his entrance open,
	Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
	I will devise a death as cruel for thee
	As thou art tender to't.

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
