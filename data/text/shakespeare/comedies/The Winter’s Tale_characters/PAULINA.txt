	The keeper of the prison, call to him;
	Let him have knowledge who I am.—<STAGE DIR>
<Exit an Attendant.>
</STAGE DIR> Good lady,
	No court in Europe is too good for thee;
	What dost thou then in prison?

<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Attendant with the Gaoler.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, good sir,
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<PAULINA>	<24%>
	Pray you then,
	Conduct me to the queen.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<PAULINA>	<24%>
	Here's ado,
	To lock up honesty and honour from
	The access of gentle visitors! Is't lawful, pray you,
	To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<PAULINA>	<24%>
	I pray now, call her.
	Withdraw yourselves.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<PAULINA>	<24%>
	Well, be't so, prithee.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Gaoler.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Here's such ado to make no stain a stain,
	As passes colouring.

<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Gaoler, with Emilia.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Dear gentlewoman,
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<PAULINA>	<25%>
	A boy?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<PAULINA>	<25%>
	I dare be sworn:
	These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!
	He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
	Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me.
	If I prove honey-mouth'd, let my tongue blister,
	And never to my red-look'd anger be
	The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
	Commend my best obedience to the queen:
	If she dares trust me with her little babe,
	I'll show it to the king and undertake to be
	Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
	How he may soften at the sight of the child:
	The silence often of pure innocence
	Persuades when speaking fails.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<PAULINA>	<26%>
	Tell her, Emilia,
	I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
	As boldness from my bosom, let it not be doubted
	I shall do good.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<PAULINA>	<26%>
	You need not fear it, sir:
	The child was prisoner to the womb, and is
	By law and process of great nature thence
	Freed and enfranchis'd; not a party to
	The anger of the king, nor guilty of,
	If any be, the trespass of the queen.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>
<PAULINA>	<26%>
	Do not you fear: upon mine honour, I
	Will stand betwixt you and danger.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
<PAULINA>	<27%>
	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
	Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
	Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
	More free than he is jealous.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
<PAULINA>	<27%>
	Not so hot, good sir;
	I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
	That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
	At each his needless heavings, such as you
	Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
	Do come with words as med'cinal as true,
	Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
	That presses him from sleep.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
<PAULINA>	<28%>
	No noise, my lord; but needful conference
	About some gossips for your highness.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><27%>
<PAULINA>	<28%>
	From all dishonesty he can: in this,
	Unless he take the course that you have done,
	Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
	He shall not rule me.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
<PAULINA>	<28%>
	Good my liege, I come,
	And I beseech you, hear me, who professes
	Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
	Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dares
	Less appear so in comforting your evils
	Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
	From your good queen.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
<PAULINA>	<28%>
	Good queen, my lord, good queen; I say, good queen;
	And would by combat make her good, so were I
	A man, the worst about you.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
<PAULINA>	<28%>
	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
	First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
	But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
	For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter:
	Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
<PAULINA>	<29%>
	Not so;
	I am as ignorant in that as you
	In so entitling me, and no less honest
	Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
	As this world goes, to pass for honest.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><28%>
<PAULINA>	<29%>
	For ever
	Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
	Tak'st up the princess by that forced baseness
	Which he has put upon't!
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
<PAULINA>	<29%>
	So I would you did; then, 'twere past all doubt,
	You'd call your children yours.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
<PAULINA>	<29%>
	Nor I; nor any
	But one that's here, and that's himself; for he
	The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
	His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
	Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; and will not,—
	For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
	He cannot be compell'd to't,—once remove
	The root of his opinion, which is rotten
	As ever oak or stone was sound.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>
<PAULINA>	<29%>
	It is yours;
	And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
	'So like you, 'tis the worse.' Behold, my lords,
	Although the print be little, the whole matter
	And copy of the father; eye, nose, lip,
	The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
	The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his smiles,
	The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
	And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
	So like to him that got it, if thou hast
	The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
	No yellow in't; lest she suspect, as he does,
	Her children not her husband's.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<PAULINA>	<30%>
	A most unworthy and unnatural lord
	Can do no more.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<PAULINA>	<30%>
	I care not:
	It is a heretic that makes the fire,
	Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
	But this most cruel usage of your queen,—
	Not able to produce more accusation
	Than your own weak-hing'd fancy,—something savours
	Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,
	Yea, scandalous to the world.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<PAULINA>	<30%>
	I pray you do not push me; I'll be gone.
	Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: Jove send her
	A better guiding spirit! What need these hands?
	You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
	Will never do him good, not one of you.
	So, so: farewell; we are gone.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><38%>
<PAULINA>	<39%>
	This news is mortal to the queen:— look down,
	And see what death is doing.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><39%>
<PAULINA>	<40%>
	Woe the while!
	O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
	Break too!
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><39%>
<PAULINA>	<40%>
	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
	What wheels? racks? fires? What flaying? or what boiling
	In leads, or oils? what old or newer torture
	Must I receive, whose every word deserves
	To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,
	Together working with thy jealousies,
	Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
	For girls of nine, O! think what they have done,
	And then run mad indeed, stark mad; for all
	Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
	That thou betray'dst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
	That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant
	And damnable ingrateful; nor was't much
	Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour
	To have him kill a king; poor trespasses,
	More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
	The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
	To be or none or little; though a devil
	Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
	Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
	Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,—
	Thoughts high for one so tender,—cleft the heart
	That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
	Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
	Laid to thy answer: but the last,—O lords!
	When I have said, cry, 'woe!'—the queen, the queen,
	The sweetest, dearest creature's dead, and vengeance for't
	Not dropp'd down yet.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><40%>
<PAULINA>	<41%>
	I say she's dead; I'll swear't: if word nor oath
	Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
	Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
	Heat outwardly, or breath within, I'll serve you
	As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
	Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
	Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
	To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
	Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
	Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
	In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
	To look that way thou wert.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><41%>
<PAULINA>	<41%>
	I am sorry for't:
	All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
	I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
	The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
	To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
	Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
	At my petition; I beseech you, rather
	Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
	Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
	Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
	The love I bore your queen,—lo, fool again!—
	I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
	I'll not remember you of my own lord,
	Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
	And I'll say nothing.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<PAULINA>	<82%>
	True, too true, my lord;
	If one by one you wedded all the world,
	Or from the all that are took something good,
	To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
	Would be unparallel'd.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<PAULINA>	<82%>
	You are one of those
	Would have him wed again.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<PAULINA>	<82%>
	There is none worthy,
	Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
	Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
	For has not the divine Apollo said,
	Is't not the tenour of his oracle,
	That King Leontes shall not have an heir
	Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
	Is all as monstrous to our human reason
	As my Antigonus to break his grave
	And come again to me; who, on my life,
	Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
	My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
	Oppose against their wills.—<STAGE DIR>
<To Leontes.>
</STAGE DIR> Care not for issue;
	The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
	Left his to the worthiest, so his successor
	Was like to be the best.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<PAULINA>	<83%>
	And left them
	More rich, for what they yielded.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<83%>
	Had she such power,
	She had just cause.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<83%>
	I should so:
	Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'd bid you mark
	Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
	You chose her; then I'd shriek, that even your ears
	Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
	Should be 'Remember mine.'
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<83%>
	Will you swear
	Never to marry but by my free leave?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<83%>
	Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<84%>
	Unless another,
	As like Hermione as is her picture,
	Affront his eye.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<84%>
	I have done.
	Yet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir,
	No remedy, but you will,—give me the office
	To choose you a queen, she shall not be so young
	As was your former; but she shall be such
	As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy
	To see her in your arms.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<PAULINA>	<84%>
	That
	Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
	Never till then.

</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<PAULINA>	<84%>
	O Hermione!
	As every present time doth boast itself
	Above a better gone, so must thy grave
	Give way to what's seen now. Sir, you yourself
	Have said and writ so,—but your writing now
	Is colder than that theme,—'She had not been,
	Nor was not to be equall'd;' thus your verse
	Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd
	To say you have seen a better.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<PAULINA>	<85%>
	How! not women?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<PAULINA>	<85%>
	Had our prince—
	Jewel of children—seen this hour, he had pair'd
	Well with this lord: there was not full a month
	Between their births.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<PAULINA>	<88%>
	Sir, my liege,
	Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
	'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
	Than what you look on now.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<PAULINA>	<95%>
	What, sovereign sir,
	I did not well, I meant well. All my services
	You have paid home; but that you have vouchsaf'd,
	With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
	Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
	It is a surplus of your grace, which never
	My life may last to answer.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
<PAULINA>	<95%>
	As she liv'd peerless,
	So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
	Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
	Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
	Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
	To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
	Still sleep mock'd death: behold! and say 'tis well.
<STAGE DIR>
<Paulina draws back a curtain, and discovers Hermione as a statue.>
</STAGE DIR>
	I like your silence: it the more shows off
	Your wonder; but yet speak: first you, my liege.
	Comes it not something near?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
<PAULINA>	<96%>
	So much the more our carver's excellence;
	Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
	As she liv'd now.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PAULINA>	<96%>
	O, patience!
	The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's
	Not dry.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PAULINA>	<97%>
	Indeed, my lord,
	If I had thought the sight of my poor image
	Would thus have wrought you,—for the stone is mine,—
	I'd not have show'd it.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<PAULINA>	<97%>
	No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
	May think anon it moves.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PAULINA>	<97%>
	I'll draw the curtain;
	My lord's almost so far transported that
	He'll think anon it lives.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PAULINA>	<97%>
	I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
	I could afflict you further.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PAULINA>	<97%>
	Good my lord, forbear.
	The ruddiness upon her lip is wet:
	You'll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own
	With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PAULINA>	<98%>
	Either forbear,
	Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
	For more amazement. If you can behold it,
	I'll make the statue move indeed, descend,
	And take you by the hand; but then you'll think,—
	Which I protest against,—I am assisted
	By wicked powers.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<PAULINA>	<98%>
	It is requir'd
	You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still;
	Or those that think it is unlawful business
	I am about, let them depart.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<PAULINA>	<98%>
	Music, awake her: strike!
<STAGE DIR>
<Music.>
</STAGE DIR>
	'Tis time; descend; be stone no more: approach;
	Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come;
	I'll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away;
	Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
	Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
<STAGE DIR>
<Hermione comes down.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Start not; her actions shall be holy as
	You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
	Until you see her die again, for then
	You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
	When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
	Is she become the suitor!
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<PAULINA>	<99%>
	That she is living,
	Were it but told you, should be hooted at
	Like an old tale; but it appears she lives,
	Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
	Please you to interpose, fair madam. kneel
	And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
	Our Perdita is found.
</PAULINA>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<PAULINA>	<99%>
	There's time enough for that;
	Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
	Your joys with like relation. Go together,
	You precious winners all: your exultation
	Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
	Will wing me to some wither'd bough, and there
	My mate, that's never to be found again,
	Lament till I am lost.
</PAULINA>
