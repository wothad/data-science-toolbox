	Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,
	As far as toucheth my particular,
	Yet, dread Priam,
	There is no lady of more softer bowels,
	More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
	More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
	Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,
	Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
	The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
	To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
	Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
	Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
	Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
	If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
	To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
	Had it our name, the value of one ten,
	What merit's in that reason which denies
	The yielding of her up?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<HECTOR>	<28%>
	Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
	The holding.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<HECTOR>	<28%>
	But value dwells not in particular will;
	It holds his estimate and dignity
	As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
	As in the prizer. 'Tis mad idolatry
	To make the service greater than the god;
	And the will dotes that is inclinable
	To what infectiously itself affects,
	Without some image of the affected merit.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<HECTOR>	<30%>
	It is Cassandra.

</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<HECTOR>	<30%>
	Peace, sister, peace!
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<HECTOR>	<30%>
	Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
	Of divination in our sister work
	Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
	So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
	Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
	Can qualify the same?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<HECTOR>	<32%>
	Paris and Troilus, you have both said well;
	And on the cause and question now in hand
	Have gloz'd, but superficially; not much
	Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
	Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
	The reasons you allege do more conduce
	To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
	Than to make up a free determination
	'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
	Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
	Of any true decision. Nature craves
	All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
	What nearer debt in all humanity
	Than wife is to the husband? if this law
	Of nature be corrupted through affection,
	And that great minds, of partial indulgence
	To their benumbed wills, resist the saine;
	There is a law in each well-order'd nation
	To curb those raging appetites that are
	Most disobedient and refractory.
	If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
	As it is known she is, these moral laws
	Of nature, and of nations, speak aloud
	To have her back return'd: thus to persist
	In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
	But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
	Is this, in way of truth; yet, ne'ertheless,
	My spritely brethren, I propend to you
	In resolution to keep Helen still;
	For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
	Upon our joint and several dignities.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<HECTOR>	<33%>
	I am yours,
	You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
	I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
	The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
	Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.
	I was advertis'd their great general slept
	Whilst emulation in the army crept:
	This, I presume, will wake him.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<HECTOR>	<74%>
	Why, then will I no more:
	Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
	A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
	The obligation of our blood forbids
	A gory emulation 'twixt us twain.
	Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
	That thou couldst say, 'This hand is Grecian all,
	And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
	All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
	Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
	Bounds in my father's,' by Jove multipotent,
	Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
	Wherein my sword had not impressure made
	Of our rank feud. But the just gods gainsay
	That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
	My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
	Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax;
	By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
	Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
	Cousin, all honour to thee!
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<HECTOR>	<75%>
	Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
	On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st byes
	Cries, 'This is he!' could promise to himself
	A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<HECTOR>	<75%>
	We'll answer it;
	The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<HECTOR>	<75%>
	Æneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
	And signify this loving interview
	To the expecters of our Trojan part;
	Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
	I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<HECTOR>	<75%>
	The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
	But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
	Shall find him by his large and portly size.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<HECTOR>	<75%>
	I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<HECTOR>	<76%>
	Whom must we answer?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<HECTOR>	<76%>
	O! you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
	Mock not that I affect the untraded oath;
	Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
	She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<HECTOR>	<76%>
	O! pardon; I offend.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<HECTOR>	<76%>
	Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
	That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
	Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<76%>
	I would they could.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
	Ah! sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
	Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
	In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	I must not believe you:
	There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
	The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
	A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
	And that old common arbitrator, Time,
	Will one day end it.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	Is this Achilles?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 5><76%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	Nay, I have done already.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<HECTOR>	<77%>
	O! like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
	But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
	Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<HECTOR>	<78%>
	It would discredit the bless'd gods, proud man,
	To answer such a question. Stand again:
	Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
	As to prenominate in nice conjecture
	Where thou wilt hit me dead?
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<HECTOR>	<78%>
	Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
	I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,
	For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
	But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
	I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
	You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
	His insolence draws folly from my lips;
	But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
	Or may I never—
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<HECTOR>	<78%>
	I pray you, let us see you in the field;
	We have had pelting wars since you refus'd
	The Grecians' cause.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<HECTOR>	<78%>
	Thy hand upon that match.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<HECTOR>	<81%>
	I trouble you.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<HECTOR>	<81%>
	Thanks and good-night to the Greeks' general.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<HECTOR>	<81%>
	Good-night, sweet Lord Menelaus.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<HECTOR>	<82%>
	Give me your hand.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<HECTOR>	<82%>
	And so, good-night.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<HECTOR>	<88%>
	You train me to offend you; get you in:
	By all the everlasting gods, I'll go.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<HECTOR>	<89%>
	No more, I say.

</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<HECTOR>	<89%>
	Ho! bid my trumpet sound.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<HECTOR>	<89%>
	Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<HECTOR>	<89%>
	Hold you still, I say;
	Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
	Life every man holds dear; but the dear man
	Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.

</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<HECTOR>	<89%>
	No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
	I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
	Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
	And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
	Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
	I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<HECTOR>	<90%>
	What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
</HECTOR>

	O! 'tis fair play.

	Æneas is a-field;

</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<HECTOR>	<91%>
	I must not break my faith.
	You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
	Let me not shame respect, but give me leave
	To take that course by your consent and voice,
	Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<HECTOR>	<91%>
	Andromache, I am offended with you:
	Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<HECTOR>	<91%>
	You are amaz'd, my liege, at her exclaim.
	Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight;
	Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.

	What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?

	I do believe thee: live.

	Pause, if thou wilt.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<HECTOR>	<96%>
	Fare thee well:—

</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 6><96%>
<HECTOR>	<96%>
	Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark.
	No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
	I'll frush it, and unlock the rivets all,
	But I'll be master of it. Wilt thou not, beast, abide?
	Why then, fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
</HECTOR>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 8><97%>
<HECTOR>	<97%>
	Most putrefied core, so fair without,
	Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
	Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
	Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
