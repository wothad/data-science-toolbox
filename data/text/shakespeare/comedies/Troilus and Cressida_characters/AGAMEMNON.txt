	Princes,
	What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
	The ample proposition that hope makes
	In all designs begun on earth below
	Fails in the promis'd largeness: checks and disasters
	Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd;
	As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
	Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
	Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
	Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
	That we come short of our suppose so far
	That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
	Sith every action that hath gone before,
	Whereof we have record, trial did draw
	Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
	And that unbodied figure of the thought
	That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
	Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
	And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
	But the protractive trials of great Jove,
	To find persistive constancy in men:
	The fineness of which metal is not found
	In Fortune's love; for then, the bold and coward,
	The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
	The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin:
	But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
	Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
	Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
	And what hath mass or matter, by itself
	Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<15%>
	Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
	That matter needless, of importless burden,
	Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
	When rank Thersites opes his mastick jaws,
	We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.
</AGAMEMNON>

<AGAMEMNON>	<17%>
	The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
	What is the remedy?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<18%>
	What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	What would you 'fore our tent?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	Even this.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
	'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
	Call Agamemnon head and general.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	How!
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
	Are ceremonious courtiers.

	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Æneas?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	What's your affair, I pray you?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<19%>
	He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<20%>
	Speak frankly as the wind:
	It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour;
	That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,
	He tells thee so himself.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<20%>
	This shall be told our lovers, Lord Æneas;
	If none of them have soul in such a kind,
	We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
	And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
	That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
	If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
	That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><20%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<21%>
	Fair Lord Æneas, let me touch your hand;
	To our pavilion shall I lead you first.
	Achilles shall have word of this intent;
	So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
	Yourself shall feast with us before you go,
	And find the welcome of a noble foe.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<35%>
	Where is Achilles?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<35%>
	Let it be known to him that we are here.
	He shent our messengers; and we lay by
	Our appertainments, visiting of him:
	Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
	We dare not move the question of our place,
	Or know not what we are.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<36%>
	Hear you, Patroclus:
	We are too well acquainted with these answers:
	But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
	Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
	Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
	Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
	Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
	Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
	Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
	Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
	We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin
	If you do say we think him over-proud
	And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
	Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself
	Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
	Disguise the holy strength of their command,
	And underwrite in an observing kind
	His humorous predominance; yea, watch
	His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
	The passage and whole carriage of this action
	Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
	That if he overhold his price so much,
	We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
	Not portable, lie under this report:
	'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:'
	A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
	Before a sleeping giant: tell him so.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<37%>
	In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
	We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<37%>
	No more than what he thinks he is.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<37%>
	No question.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<37%>
	No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<37%>
	Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours the deed in the praise.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<38%>
	What's his excuse?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<38%>
	Why will he not upon our fair request
	Untent his person and share the air with us?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<38%>
	Let Ajax go to him.
	Dear lord, go you and meet him in his tent:
	'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
	At your request a little from himself.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<39%>
	O, no! you shall not go.
</AGAMEMNON>

	Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
	Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.

</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<51%>
	What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<52%>
	Let Diomedes bear him,
	And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
	What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
	Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
	Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
	Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<52%>
	We'll execute your purpose, and put on
	A form of strangeness as we pass along:
	So do each lord, and either greet him not,
	Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
	Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<52%>
	What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<53%>
	The better.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 5><69%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<70%>
	Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
	Anticipating time with starting courage.
	Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
	Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
	May pierce the head of the great combatant
	And hale him hither.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<71%>
	Is not yond Diomed with Calchas' daughter?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<71%>
	Is this the Lady Cressid?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<71%>
	Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 5><71%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<72%>
	Yonder comes the troop.

</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<72%>
	Which way would Hector have it?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<73%>
	Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
	Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord Æneas
	Consent upon the order of their fight,
	So be it; either to the uttermost,
	Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
	Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<73%>
	What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>

	They are in action.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<74%>
	His blows are well dispos'd: there, Ajax!
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<75%>
	Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
	That would be rid of such an enemy;
	But that's no welcome; understand more clear,
	What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
	And formless ruin of oblivion;
	But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
	Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
	Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
	From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 5><77%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<78%>
	First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
	There in the full convive we afterwards,
	As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
	Concur together, severally entreat him.
	Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
	That this great soldier may his welcome know.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>

	We go wrong, we go wrong.

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<81%>
	So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good-night.
	Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<82%>
	Good-night.
</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<93%>
	Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
	Hath beat down Menon; bastard Margarelon
	Hath Doreus prisoner,
	And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
	Upon the pashed corses of the kings
	Epistrophus and Cedius; Polixenes is slain;
	Amphimachus, and Thoas, deadly hurt;
	Patroclus ta'en, or slain; and Palamedes
	Sore hurt and bruis'd; the dreadful Sagittary
	Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
	To reinforcement, or we perish all.

</AGAMEMNON>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 9><97%>
<AGAMEMNON>	<98%>
	Hark! hark! what shout is that?

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 9><98%>

	March patiently along. Let one be sent

	If in his death the gods have us befriended,
	Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
