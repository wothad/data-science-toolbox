<SPEECH 1><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<PATROCLUS>	<26%>
	Good words, Thersites.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PATROCLUS>	<26%>
	No more words, Thersites; peace!
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PATROCLUS>	<27%>
	A good riddance.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<PATROCLUS>	<31%>
	Paris, you speak
	Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
	You have the honey still, but these the gall;
	So to be valiant is no praise at all.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	What! art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	Thersites, my lord.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what's thyself?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	Thou mayst tell that knowest.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<PATROCLUS>	<34%>
	You rascal!
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<PATROCLUS>	<35%>
	Why am I a fool?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<PATROCLUS>	<35%>
	Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<PATROCLUS>	<35%>
	I shall say so to him.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<PATROCLUS>	<36%>
	Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry
	If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
	Did move your greatness and this noble state
	To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
	But, for your health and your digestion sake,
	An after-dinner's breath.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<PATROCLUS>	<37%>
	I shall; and bring his answer presently.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
<PATROCLUS>	<53%>
	They pass by strangely: they were us'd to bend,
	To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
	To come as humbly as they us'd to creep
	To holy altars.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<PATROCLUS>	<57%>
	To this effect, Achilles, have I mov'd you.
	A woman impudent and mannish grown
	Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
	In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this:
	They think my little stomach to the war
	And your great love to me restrains you thus.
	Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
	Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
	And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
	Be shook to air.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<PATROCLUS>	<57%>
	Ay; and perhaps receive much honour by him.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<PATROCLUS>	<57%>
	O! then, beware;
	Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
	Omission to do what is necessary
	Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
	And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
	Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	Jove bless great Ajax!
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	I come from the worthy Achilles,—
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,—
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	Ay, my lord.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	What say you to't?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	Your answer, sir.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<PATROCLUS>	<59%>
	Your answer, sir.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<PATROCLUS>	<71%>
	But that's no argument for kissing now;
	For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
	And parted thus you and your argument.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<PATROCLUS>	<71%>
	The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
	Patroclus kisses you.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<PATROCLUS>	<71%>
	Paris and I, kiss evermore for him.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<PATROCLUS>	<71%>
	Both take and give.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<PATROCLUS>	<79%>
	Here comes Thersites.

</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<79%>
	Who keeps the tent now?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<80%>
	Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<80%>
	Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<80%>
	Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<80%>
	Why, no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.
</PATROCLUS>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<PATROCLUS>	<80%>
	Out, gall!
</PATROCLUS>
