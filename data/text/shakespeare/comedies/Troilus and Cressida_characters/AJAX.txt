<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<AJAX>	<35%>
	Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man; but, by my head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.

<AJAX>	<37%>
	What is he more than another?
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>

	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AJAX>	<37%>
	Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<AJAX>	<37%>
	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>

	I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<AJAX>	<39%>
	A paltry, insolent fellow!

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<AJAX>	<39%>
	Can he not be sociable?
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>

	I'll let his humours blood.

	Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
	Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
	Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek

	Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood;
	Thou blow'st for Hector.
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<AJAX>	<74%>
	I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<AJAX>	<75%>
	I thank thee, Hector:
	Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
	I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
	A great addition earned in thy death.
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<AJAX>	<75%>
	If I might in entreaties find success,—

	Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

<AJAX>	<78%>
	Do not chafe thee, cousin:
	And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
	Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
	You may have every day enough of Hector,
	If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
	Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.

	What wouldst thou?
</AJAX>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<AJAX>	<95%>
	Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
	Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!

</AJAX>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<AJAX>	<95%>
	I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.

	If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
	Great Hector was a man as good as he.
