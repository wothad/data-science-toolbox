	After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
	Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
	'Deliver Helen, and all damage else,
	As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
	Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
	In hot digestion of this cormorant war,
	Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?

	Come, Hector, come; go back:
	Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
	Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
	Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt,
	To tell thee that this day is ominous:
	Therefore, come back.
