	Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,

	Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
	Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
	Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
	A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
	Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
	Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
	Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
	Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe!
	Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.

	No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.

	The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
	They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
	Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>

	It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
	But vows to every purpose must not hold.
	Unarm, sweet Hector.

	Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
	He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,

	Fall all together.

	O Priam! yield not to him.

<CASSANDRA>	<91%>
	O farewell! dear Hector.
	Look! how thou diest; look! how thy eye turns pale;
	Look! how thy wounds do bleed at many vents:
	Hark! how Troy roars: how Hecuba cries out!
	How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
	Behold, distraction, frenzy, and amazement,
	Like witless anticks, one another meet,
	And all cry Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
</CASSANDRA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<CASSANDRA>	<91%>
	Farewell. Yet, soft! Hector, I take my leave:
	Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
