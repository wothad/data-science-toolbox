<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And how his silence drinks up this applause!

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<DIOMEDES>	<39%>
	You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<DIOMEDES>	<40%>
	Or covetous of praise,—
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<DIOMEDES>	<40%>
	Or strange, or self-affected!
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<DIOMEDES>	<40%>
	Be rul'd by him, Lord Ajax.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><51%>
<DIOMEDES>	<52%>
	This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
	Which I am proud to bear.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas.>
</STAGE DIR>

</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIOMEDES>	<60%>
	That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Æneas.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIOMEDES>	<60%>
	The one and other Diomed embraces.
	Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health!
	But when contention and occasion meet,
	By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
	With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIOMEDES>	<60%>
	We sympathize. Jove, let Æneas live,
	If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
	A thousand complete courses of the sun!
	But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
	With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><59%>
<DIOMEDES>	<60%>
	We do; and long to know each other worse.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<DIOMEDES>	<61%>
	Both alike:
	He merits well to have her that doth seek her—
	Not making any scruple of her soilure—
	With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
	And you as well to keep her that defend her—
	Not palating the taste of her dishonour—
	With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
	He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
	The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
	You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
	Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors:
	Both merits pois'd, each weighs nor less nor more;
	But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><60%>
<DIOMEDES>	<61%>
	She's bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:
	For every false drop in her bawdy veins
	A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
	Of her contaminated carrion weight
	A Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,
	She hath not given so many good words breath
	As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
<DIOMEDES>	<69%>
	Fair Lady Cressid,
	So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
	The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
	Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
	You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 4><68%>
<DIOMEDES>	<69%>
	O! be not mov'd, Prince Troilus:
	Let me be privileg'd by my place and message
	To be a speaker free; when I am hence,
	I'll answer to my lust; and know you, lord,
	I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
	She shall be priz'd; but that you say 'be't so,'
	I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 5><70%>
<DIOMEDES>	<71%>
	Even she.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 5><71%>
<DIOMEDES>	<72%>
	Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<DIOMEDES>	<74%>
	You must no more.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<DIOMEDES>	<74%>
	As Hector pleases.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<DIOMEDES>	<75%>
	'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
	Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<DIOMEDES>	<82%>
	I cannot, lord; I have important business,
	The tide whereof is now. Good-night, great Hector.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<82%>
	What, are you up here, ho! speak.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<82%>
	Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	How now, my charge!
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	Will you remember?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	Nay, but do, then;
	And let your mind be coupled with your words.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	Nay, then,—
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><82%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	What did you swear you would bestow on me?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	Good-night.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
<DIOMEDES>	<83%>
	No, no, good-night; I'll be your fool no more.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
<DIOMEDES>	<84%>
	And so, good-night.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 2><83%>
<DIOMEDES>	<84%>
	Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<DIOMEDES>	<84%>
	But will you, then?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<DIOMEDES>	<84%>
	Give me some token for the surety of it.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	Whose was't?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	I shall have it.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	Ay, that.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	I had your heart before; this follows it.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	I will have this. Whose was it?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	Come, tell me whose it was.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	Whose was it?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
	And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	Why then, farewell;
	Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<85%>
	I do not like this fooling.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<86%>
	What, shall I come? the hour?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<DIOMEDES>	<86%>
	Farewell till then.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
<DIOMEDES>	<93%>
	Thou dost miscall retire:
	I do not fly; but advantageous care
	Withdrew me from the odds of multitude.
	Have at thee!
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<DIOMEDES>	<93%>
	Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
	Present the fair steed to my Lady Cressid:
	Fellow, commend my service to her beauty:
	Tell her I have chastis'd the amorous Trojan,
	And am her knight by proof.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
<DIOMEDES>	<95%>
	Ay, there, there.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<DIOMEDES>	<95%>
	Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<DIOMEDES>	<95%>
	I would correct him.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<DIOMEDES>	<95%>
	Ha! art thou there?
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 6><95%>
<DIOMEDES>	<95%>
	He is my prize; I will not look upon.
</DIOMEDES>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 9><98%>
<DIOMEDES>	<98%>
	The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
</DIOMEDES>
