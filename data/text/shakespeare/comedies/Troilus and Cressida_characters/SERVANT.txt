	Sir, I do depend upon the Lord.

	The Lord be praised!

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<SERVANT>	<41%>
	Faith, sir, superficially.

	I hope I shall know your honour better.

	You are in the state of grace.

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<SERVANT>	<41%>
	That's to't, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heartblood of beauty, love's invisible soul.

	No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her attributes?

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<SERVANT>	<42%>
	Sodden business: there's a stewed phrase, indeed.
