<LUCETTA>	<7%>
	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LUCETTA>	<7%>
	Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
	According to my shallow simple skill.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
	But, were I you, he never should be mine.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
	That I, unworthy body as I am,
	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Then thus,—of many good I think him best.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	I have no other but a woman's reason:
	I think him so because I think him so.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Yet he of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<8%>
	Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	O! they love least that let men know their love.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	Peruse this paper, madam.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	That the contents will show.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	Sir Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus.
	He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
	Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
<LUCETTA>	<9%>
	That you may ruminate.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	What would your ladyship?
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	I would it were;
	That you might kill your stomach on your meat
	And not upon your maid.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	Nothing.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<10%>
	To take a paper up
	That I let fall.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Nothing concerning me.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
	Unless it have a false interpreter.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune:
	Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	It is too heavy for so light a tune.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	I cannot reach so high.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
	And yet methinks, I do not like this tune.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	No, madam; it is too sharp.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<11%>
	Nay, now you are too flat
	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
	There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<LUCETTA>	<12%>
	Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
<LUCETTA>	<12%>
	She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
	To be so anger'd with another letter.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Madam,
	Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	What! shall these papers he like tell-tales here?
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
	Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<LUCETTA>	<13%>
	Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
	I see things too, although you judge I wink.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 7><43%>
<LUCETTA>	<43%>
	Alas! the way is wearisome and long.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 7><43%>
<LUCETTA>	<43%>
	Better forbear till Proteus make return.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 7><44%>
<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
	But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 7><44%>
<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	But in what habit will you go along?
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
<LUCETTA>	<44%>
	Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	You must needs have them with a cod-piece, madam.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 7><45%>
<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
	Unless you have a cod-piece to stick pins on.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
<LUCETTA>	<45%>
	Then never dream on infamy, but go.
	If Proteus like your journey when you come,
	No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone.
	I fear me, he will scarce be pleas'd withal.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
<LUCETTA>	<46%>
	All these are servants to deceitful men.
</LUCETTA>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 7><46%>
<LUCETTA>	<46%>
	Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him!
</LUCETTA>
