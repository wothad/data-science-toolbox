<THURIO>	<30%>
	Seem you that you are not?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	So do counterfeits.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	What seem I that I am not?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	What instance of the contrary?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	And how quote you my folly?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	My jerkin is a doublet.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	How?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<THURIO>	<30%>
	Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<THURIO>	<31%>
	Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.

	They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
<THURIO>	<63%>
	Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,
	Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
	That I am desperate of obtaining her.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
<THURIO>	<65%>
	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
	You must provide to bottom it on me;
	Which must be done by praising me as much
	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><66%>
<THURIO>	<67%>
	And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.
	Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
	Let us into the city presently
	To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
	I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
	To give the onset to thy good advice.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
<THURIO>	<71%>
	How now, Sir Proteus! are you crept before us?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
<THURIO>	<71%>
	Ay; but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><71%>
<THURIO>	<72%>
	Who? Silvia?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
<THURIO>	<72%>
	I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
	Let's tune, and to it lustily a while.

</THURIO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
<THURIO>	<74%>
	Where meet we?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
<THURIO>	<74%>
	Farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Thurio and Musicians.>
</STAGE DIR>

</THURIO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	What! that my leg is too long?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	What says she to my face?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	How likes she my discourse?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<89%>
	What says she to my valour?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<90%>
	What says she to my birth?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<90%>
	Considers she my possessions?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<THURIO>	<90%>
	Wherefore?
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<THURIO>	<90%>
	Not I.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<THURIO>	<91%>
	Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
	That flies her fortune when it follows her.
	I'll after, more to be reveng'd on Eglamour
	Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<THURIO>	<98%>
	Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
</THURIO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
<THURIO>	<98%>
	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I.
	I hold him but a fool that will endanger
	His body for a girl that loves him not:
	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
</THURIO>
