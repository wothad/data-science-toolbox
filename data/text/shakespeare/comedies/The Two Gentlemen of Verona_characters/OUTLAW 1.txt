	Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<68%>
	That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<68%>
	Whence came you?
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<68%>
	Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
	But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<69%>
	We'll have him: Sirs, a word.
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<69%>
	And I for such like petty crimes as these.
	But to the purpose; for we cite our faults,
	That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
	And, partly, seeing you are beautified
	With goodly shape, and by your own report
	A linguist, and a man of such perfection
	As we do in our quality much want—
</OUTLAW 1>

	Come, come,
	Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

	Where is the gentleman that was with her?
</OUTLAW 1>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<OUTLAW 1>	<92%>
	Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave.
	Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
	And will not use a woman lawlessly.
