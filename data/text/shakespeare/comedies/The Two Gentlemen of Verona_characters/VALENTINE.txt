	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
	Were't not affection chains thy tender days
	To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
	I rather would entreat thy company
	To see the wonders of the world abroad
	Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,
	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
	But since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,
	Even as I would when I to love begin.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	And on a love-book pray for my success?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	That's on some shallow story of deep love,
	How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<VALENTINE>	<1%>
	'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
	And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.

	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
	If lost, why then a grievous labour won:
	However, but a folly bought with wit,
	Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	Love is your master, for he masters you;
	And he that is so yoked by a fool,
	Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<VALENTINE>	<2%>
	And writers say, as the most forward bud
	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
	Even so by love the young and tender wit
	Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,
	Losing his verdure even in the prime,
	And all the fair effects of future hopes.
	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
	That art a votary to fond desire?
	Once more adieu! my father at the road
	Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.

	Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters

</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<VALENTINE>	<3%>
	As much to you at home! and so, farewell.

</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine;

	Ah Silvia! Silvia!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	How now, sirrah?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Well, you'll still be too forward.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Go to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><18%>
<VALENTINE>	<18%>
	Why, how know you that I am in love?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<VALENTINE>	<19%>
	Are all these things perceived in me?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<VALENTINE>	<19%>
	Without me? they cannot.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><19%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	What dost thou know?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How painted? and how out of count?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<20%>
	How long hath she been deformed?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Why?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	What should I see then?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<21%>
	I have.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
	Peace! here she comes.

</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
	Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
	Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
	But for my duty to your ladyship.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	Now, trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
	For, being ignorant to whom it goes
	I writ at random, very doubtfully.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<VALENTINE>	<22%>
	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
	Please you command, a thousand times as much.
	And yet—
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	Madam, they are for you.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<VALENTINE>	<23%>
	If it please me, madam, what then?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	How now, sir! what are you reasoning with yourself?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	To do what?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	To whom?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	What figure?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	Why, she hath not writ to me?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	No, believe me.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	She gave me none, except an angry word.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<VALENTINE>	<24%>
	That's the letter I writ to her friend.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<VALENTINE>	<25%>
	I would it were no worse.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<VALENTINE>	<25%>
	I have dined.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 4><29%>
<VALENTINE>	<29%>
	Mistress?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 2><SCENE 4><29%>
<VALENTINE>	<29%>
	Ay, boy, it's for love.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 2><SCENE 4><29%>
<VALENTINE>	<29%>
	Of my mistress, then.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Indeed, madam, I seem so.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Haply I do.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	So do you.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Wise.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Your folly.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	I quote it in your jerkin.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Well, then, I'll double your folly.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 2><SCENE 4><30%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	You have said, sir.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	I know it well, sir: you always end ere you begin.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<VALENTINE>	<30%>
	Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	I know it well, sir: you have an exchequer of words, and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	My lord, I will be thankful
	To any happy messenger from thence.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	Ay, my good lord; I know the gentleman
	To be of worth and worthy estimation,
	And not without desert so well reputed.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
<VALENTINE>	<31%>
	Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
	The honour and regard of such a father.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
<VALENTINE>	<32%>
	I know him as myself; for from our infancy
	We have convers'd and spent our hours together:
	And though myself have been an idle truant,
	Omitting the sweet benefit of time
	To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
	Yet hath Sir Proteus,—for that's his name,—
	Made use and fair advantage of his days:
	His years but young, but his experience old;
	His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
	And, in a word,—for far behind his worth
	Come all the praises that I now bestow,—
	He is complete in feature and in mind
	With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<VALENTINE>	<32%>
	Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
	Had come along with me, but that his mistress
	Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	Why, lady, Love hath twenty pairs of eyes.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 80><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
	Upon a homely object Love can wink.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 81><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
	Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 82><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<VALENTINE>	<33%>
	Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
	To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 83><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<VALENTINE>	<34%>
	Leave off discourse of disability:
	Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<VALENTINE>	<34%>
	Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	And how do yours?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	How does your lady and how thrives your love?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
	I have done penance for contemning love;
	Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
	With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
	For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
	Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes,
	And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
	O, gentle Proteus! Love's a mighty lord,
	And hath so humbled me as I confess,
	There is no woe to his correction,
	Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
	Now no discourse, except it be of love;
	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
	Upon the very naked name of love.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<VALENTINE>	<35%>
	Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Call her divine.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	O! flatter me, for love delights in praises.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
	Yet let her be a principality,
	Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Sweet, except not any,
	Except thou wilt except against my love.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	And I will help thee to prefer her too:
	She shall be dignified with this high honour,—
	To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,
	And, of so great a favour growing proud,
	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower,
	And make rough winter everlastingly.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing.
	She is alone.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<VALENTINE>	<36%>
	Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
	And I as rich in having such a jewel
	As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
	The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
	Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
	My foolish rival, that her father likes
	Only for his possessions are so huge,
	Is gone with her along, and I must after,
	For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 96><ACT 2><SCENE 4><37%>
<VALENTINE>	<37%>
	Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our marriage-hour,
	With all the cunning manner of our flight,
	Determin'd of: how I must climb her window,
	The ladder made of cords, and all the means
	Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 97><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<VALENTINE>	<37%>
	Will you make haste?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 98><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<VALENTINE>	<49%>
	Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
	That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
	And I am going to deliver them.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 99><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<VALENTINE>	<49%>
	The tenour of them doth but signify
	My health and happy being at your court.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 100><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<VALENTINE>	<49%>
	I know it well, my lord; and sure, the match
	Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<VALENTINE>	<50%>
	What would your Grace have me to do in this?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<VALENTINE>	<50%>
	Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
	More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
	Send her another; never give her o'er,
	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
	If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
	But rather to beget more love in you;
	If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
	For why the fools are mad if left alone.
	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
	For, 'get you gone,' she doth not mean, 'away!'
	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
	Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	Why then, I would resort to her by night.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<VALENTINE>	<51%>
	What lets but one may enter at her window?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
	Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
	So bold Leander would adventure it.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
	Under a cloak that is of any length.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	Ay, my good lord.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<VALENTINE>	<52%>
	Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
<VALENTINE>	<54%>
	And why not death rather than living torment?
	To die is to be banish'd from myself;
	And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
	Is self from self,—a deadly banishment!
	What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
	What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
	Unless it be to think that she is by
	And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
	Except I be by Silvia in the night,
	There is no music in the nightingale;
	Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
	There is no day for me to look upon.
	She is my essence; and I leave to be,
	If I be not by her fair influence
	Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
	I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
	Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
	But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<VALENTINE>	<55%>
	No.

	Neither.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<VALENTINE>	<55%>
	Nothing.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<VALENTINE>	<55%>
	My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
	So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 1><55%>
<VALENTINE>	<56%>
	Is Silvia dead?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<VALENTINE>	<56%>
	No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia!
	Hath she forsworn me?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<VALENTINE>	<56%>
	No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me!
	What is your news?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 1><56%>
<VALENTINE>	<56%>
	O, I have fed upon this woe already,
	And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
	Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
<VALENTINE>	<57%>
	No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
	Have some malignant power upon my life:
	If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
	As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 1><57%>
<VALENTINE>	<58%>
	I pray thee, Launce, and if thou seest my boy,
	Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 1><58%>
<VALENTINE>	<58%>
	O my dear Silvia! hapless Valentine!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 124><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	My friends,—
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 125><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	Then know, that I have little wealth to lose.
	A man I am cross'd with adversity:
	My riches are these poor habiliments,
	Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
	You take the sum and substance that I have.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 126><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	To Verona.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	From Milan.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 128><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	Some sixteen months; and longer might have stay'd
	If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 129><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	I was.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 130><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<68%>
	For that which now torments me to rehearse.
	I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
	But yet I slew him manfully, in fight,
	Without false vantage or base treachery.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 131><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<VALENTINE>	<69%>
	I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 132><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<VALENTINE>	<69%>
	My youthful travel therein made me happy,
	Or else I often had been miserable.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 133><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<VALENTINE>	<69%>
	Peace, villain!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 134><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<VALENTINE>	<69%>
	Nothing, but my fortune.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 135><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<VALENTINE>	<70%>
	I take your offer and will live with you,
	Provided that you do no outrages
	On silly women, or poor passengers.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 136><ACT 5><SCENE 4><92%>
<VALENTINE>	<92%>
	How use doth breed a habit in a man!
	This shadowy desart, unfrequented woods,
	I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
	Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
	And to the nightingale's complaining notes
	Tune my distresses and record my woes.
	O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
	Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
	Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
	And leave no memory of what it was!
	Repair me with thy presence, Silvia!
	Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
<STAGE DIR>
<Noise within.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
	These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
	Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
	They love me well; yet I have much to do
	To keep them from uncivil outrages.
	Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
<STAGE DIR>
<Steps aside.>
</STAGE DIR>

</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 137><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
<VALENTINE>	<93%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> How like a dream is this I see and hear!
	Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 138><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<VALENTINE>	<95%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Coming forward.>
</STAGE DIR> Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch;
	Thou friend of an ill fashion!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 139><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<VALENTINE>	<95%>
	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love—
	For such is a friend now—treach'rous man!
	Thou hast beguil'd my hopes: naught but mine eye
	Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say
	I have one friend alive: thou wouldst disprove me.
	Who should be trusted now, when one's right hand
	Is perjur'd to the bosom? Proteus,
	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
	The private wound is deep'st. O time most curst!
	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 140><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<VALENTINE>	<96%>
	Then, I am paid;
	And once again I do receive thee honest.
	Who by repentance is not satisfied
	Is nor of heaven, nor earth; for these are pleas'd.
	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeas'd:
	And, that my love may appear plain and free,
	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 141><ACT 5><SCENE 4><96%>
<VALENTINE>	<96%>
	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
	Look up; speak.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 142><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<VALENTINE>	<97%>
	Come, come, a hand from either.
	Let me be blest to make this happy close:
	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 143><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<VALENTINE>	<98%>
	Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the duke.
	Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd,
	Banished Valentine.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 144><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<VALENTINE>	<98%>
	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
	Come not within the measure of my wrath;
	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
	Take but possession of her with a touch;
	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 145><ACT 5><SCENE 4><98%>
<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
	To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 146><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	These banish'd men, that I have kept withal
	Are men endu'd with worthy qualities:
	Forgive them what they have committed here,
	And let them be recall'd from their exile.
	They are reformed, civil, full of good,
	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 147><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
<VALENTINE>	<99%>
	And as we walk along, I dare be bold
	With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.
	What think you of this page, my lord?
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 148><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
<VALENTINE>	<100%>
	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
</VALENTINE>

<SPEECH 149><ACT 5><SCENE 4><99%>
<VALENTINE>	<100%>
	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance, but to hear
	The story of your loves discovered:
	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
</VALENTINE>
