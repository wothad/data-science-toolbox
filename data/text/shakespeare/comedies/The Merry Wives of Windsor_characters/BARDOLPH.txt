	Why, sir, for my part, I say, the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.

<BARDOLPH>	<6%>
	And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd; and so conclusions pass'd the careires.

	Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you: and hath sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.

	Run away, with the cozeners; for so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off, from behind one of them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
