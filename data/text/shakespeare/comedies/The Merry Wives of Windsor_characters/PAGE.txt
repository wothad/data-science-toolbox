<Within >
</STAGE DIR> Who's there?

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	Sir, I thank you.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	It could not be judged, sir.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	A cur, sir.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<3%>
	Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<4%>
	Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<PAGE>	<4%>
	Here comes Sir John.

</PAGE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<PAGE>	<5%>
	We three, to hear it and end it between them.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<PAGE>	<6%>
	Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<PAGE>	<6%>
	How now, Mistress Ford!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<PAGE>	<7%>
	Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<PAGE>	<10%>
	Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>

	By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>

	Come on, sir.

<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> 'The humour of it,' quoth'a! here's a fellow frights humour out of his wits.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<PAGE>	<25%>
	I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<PAGE>	<25%>
	I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o' the town commended him for a true man.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<PAGE>	<25%>
	How now, Meg!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<26%>
	How now, Master Ford!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<26%>
	Yes; and you heard what the other told me?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<26%>
	Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives, are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now they be out of service.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<26%>
	Marry, were they.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<26%>
	Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<PAGE>	<27%>
	Look, where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily.—

</PAGE>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<PAGE>	<28%>
	I have heard, the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<PAGE>	<28%>
	Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<PAGE>	<40%>
	Now, good Master doctor!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
<PAGE>	<40%>
	Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a man of peace.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
<PAGE>	<41%>
	'Tis true, Master Shallow.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
<PAGE>	<41%>
	Sir Hugh is there, is he?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	Save you, good Sir Hugh!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	And youthful still in your doublet and hose! this raw rheumatic day?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	We are come to you to do a good office, Master parson.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike having received wrong by some person, is at most odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the renowned French physician.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	Why?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<PAGE>	<44%>
	I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<PAGE>	<45%>
	Nay, good Master parson, keep in your weapon.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<PAGE>	<48%>
	You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you: but my wife, Master doctor, is for you altogether.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<PAGE>	<49%>
	Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having: he kept company with the wild prince and Pointz; he is of too high a region; he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance: if he take her, let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that way.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<PAGE>	<55%>
	Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<PAGE>	<56%>
	Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<PAGE>	<57%>
	Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<PAGE>	<58%>
	Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we'll a-birding together: I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<PAGE>	<60%>
	Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
	Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
	You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
	I told you, sir, my daughter is dispos'd of.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<PAGE>	<61%>
	She is no match for you.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<PAGE>	<61%>
	No, good Master Fenton.
	Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
	Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
<PAGE>	<74%>
	Why, this passes! Master Ford, you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
<PAGE>	<74%>
	This passes!
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
<PAGE>	<75%>
	Here's no man.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
<PAGE>	<75%>
	No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 2><76%>
<PAGE>	<76%>
	Let's obey his humour a little further. Come, gentlemen.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<PAGE>	<78%>
	And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<PAGE>	<78%>
	'Tis well, 'tis well; no more.
	Be not as extreme in submission
	As in ofrence;
	But let our plot go forward: let our wives
	Yet once again, to make us public sport,
	Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
	Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<PAGE>	<79%>
	How? to send him word they'll meet him in the Park at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<PAGE>	<79%>
	So think I too.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<PAGE>	<79%>
	Why, yet there want not many that do fear
	In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.
	But what of this?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<PAGE>	<79%>
	Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,
	And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
	What shall be done with him? what is your plot?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
<PAGE>	<81%>
	That silk will I go buy:—<STAGE DIR>
<Aside>
</STAGE DIR> and in that time
	Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,
	And marry her at Eton. Go, send to Falstaff straight.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<PAGE>	<89%>
	Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<PAGE>	<89%>
	The night is dark; light and spirits will become it well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns. Let's away; follow me.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
<PAGE>	<95%>
	Nay, do not fly: I think we have watch'd you now:
	Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
<PAGE>	<97%>
	Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
<PAGE>	<97%>
	And as poor as Job?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<PAGE>	<97%>
	Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her, Master Slender hath married her daughter.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<PAGE>	<98%>
	Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<PAGE>	<98%>
	Of what, son?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<PAGE>	<98%>
	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<PAGE>	<98%>
	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<PAGE>	<98%>
	O I am vexed at heart: what shall I do?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<PAGE>	<99%>
	My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.

</PAGE>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<PAGE>	<99%>
	Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
</PAGE>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<PAGE>	<100%>
	Well, what remedy?—Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
	What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.
