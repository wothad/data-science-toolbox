<SLENDER>	<1%>
	Ay, and rato-lorum too; and a gentleman born, Master Parson; who writes himself armigero, in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation,—armigero.

	All his successors gone before him hath done't; and all his ancestors that come after him may: they may give the dozen white luces in their coat.

	I may quarter, coz?

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<SLENDER>	<2%>
	Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<SLENDER>	<3%>
	How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>

	You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<SLENDER>	<4%>
	Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you; and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern, and made me drunk, and afterwards picked my pocket.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<SLENDER>	<4%>
	Ay, it is no matter.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<SLENDER>	<5%>
	Ay, it is no matter.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<SLENDER>	<5%>
	Where's Simple, my man? can you tell, cousin?
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<SLENDER>	<5%>
	Ay, by these gloves, did he,—or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else,—of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<SLENDER>	<5%>
	By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<SLENDER>	<6%>
	By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<SLENDER>	<6%>
	Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter. I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick: if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<SLENDER>	<6%>
	O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<SLENDER>	<7%>
	I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.

</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SLENDER>	<7%>
	Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable: if it be so, I shall do that that is reason.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SLENDER>	<7%>
	So I do, sir.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SLENDER>	<7%>
	Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country, simple though I stand here.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SLENDER>	<8%>
	Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
<SLENDER>	<8%>
	I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
<SLENDER>	<8%>
	I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
<SLENDER>	<8%>
	I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another: I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt: but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
<SLENDER>	<9%>
	Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SLENDER>	<9%>
	No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SLENDER>	<9%>
	I am not a-hungry, I thank you forsooth. Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Simple.>
</STAGE DIR> A justice of peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead; but what though? yet I live like a poor gentleman born.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SLENDER>	<9%>
	I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as though I did.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SLENDER>	<9%>
	I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th' other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes;—and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	That's meat and drink to me, now: I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women, indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.

</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	Nay, pray you, lead the way.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	Truly, I will not go first: truly, la! I will not do you that wrong.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SLENDER>	<10%>
	I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<SLENDER>	<40%>
	Give you good morrow, sir.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<SLENDER>	<44%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Ah, sweet Anne Page!

<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> O, sweet Anne Page!

</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<SLENDER>	<48%>
	And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I'll speak of.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<SLENDER>	<48%>
	I hope I have your good will, father Page.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<SLENDER>	<59%>
	I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't. 'Slid, 'tis but venturing.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<SLENDER>	<59%>
	No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that, but that I am afeard.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<SLENDER>	<59%>
	I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<SLENDER>	<60%>
	Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in Glostershire.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<SLENDER>	<60%>
	Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<SLENDER>	<60%>
	Now, good Mistress Anne.—
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<SLENDER>	<60%>
	My will? od's heartlings! that's a pretty jest, indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<SLENDER>	<60%>
	Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle have made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.

</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<SLENDER>	<89%>
	Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a nayword how to know one another. I come to her in white, and cry, 'mum;' she cries, 'budget;' and by that we know one another.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SLENDER>	<98%>
	Whoa, ho! ho! father Page!
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SLENDER>	<98%>
	Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloster-shire know on 't; would I were hanged, la, else!
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SLENDER>	<98%>
	I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's a great lubberly boy: if it had not been i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! and 'tis a postmaster's boy.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SLENDER>	<98%>
	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.
</SLENDER>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<SLENDER>	<98%>
	I went to her in white, and cried, 'mum,' and she cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
