	Pleaseth your highness, ay; here they are, madam:
<STAGE DIR>
<Presenting a small box.>
</STAGE DIR>
	But I beseech your Grace, without offence,—
	My conscience bids me ask,—wherefore you have
	Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
	Which are the movers of a languishing death,
	But though slow, deadly?
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<CORNELIUS>	<14%>
	Your highness
	Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
	Besides, the seeing these effects will be
	Both noisome and infectious.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<CORNELIUS>	<14%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I do suspect you, madam;
	But you shall do no harm.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<CORNELIUS>	<14%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I do not like her. She doth think she has
	Strange lingering poisons; I do know her spirit,
	And will not trust one of her malice with
	A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
	Will stupify and dull the sense awhile;
	Which first, perchance, she'll prove on cats and dogs,
	Then afterward up higher; but there is
	No danger in what show of death it makes,
	More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
	To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
	With a most false effect; and I the truer,
	So to be false with her.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<CORNELIUS>	<15%>
	I humbly take my leave.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
<CORNELIUS>	<86%>
	Hail, great king!
	To sour your happiness, I must report
	The queen is dead.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
<CORNELIUS>	<87%>
	With horror, madly dying, like her life;
	Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
	Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
	I will report, so please you: these her women
	Can trip me if I err; who with wet cheeks
	Were present when she finish'd.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
<CORNELIUS>	<87%>
	First, she confess'd she never lov'd you, only
	Affected greatness got by you, not you;
	Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
	Abhorr'd your person.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
<CORNELIUS>	<87%>
	Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
	With such integrity, she did confess
	Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
	But that her flight prevented it, she had
	Ta'en off by poison.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 5><86%>
<CORNELIUS>	<87%>
	More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
	For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
	Should by the minute feed on life, and ling'ring,
	By inches waste you; in which time she purpos'd,
	By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
	O'ercome you with her show; yea, and in time—
	When she had fitted you with her craft—to work
	Her son into the adoption of the crown;
	But failing of her end by his strange absence,
	Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
	Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
	The evils she hatch'd were not effected: so,
	Despairing died.
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
<CORNELIUS>	<93%>
	O gods!
	I left out one thing which the queen confess'd,
	Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
	Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
	Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd
	As I would serve a rat.'
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
<CORNELIUS>	<93%>
	The queen, sir, very oft importun'd me
	To temper poisons for her, still pretending
	The satisfaction of her knowledge only
	In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
	Of no esteem; I, dreading that her purpose
	Was of more danger, did compound for her
	A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
	The present power of life, but in short time
	All offices of nature should again
	Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
</CORNELIUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
<CORNELIUS>	<97%>
	By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
</CORNELIUS>
