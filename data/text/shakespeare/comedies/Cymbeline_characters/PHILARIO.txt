	His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life. Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

	Gentlemen, enough of this; it came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be better acquainted.

	Your very goodness and your company
	O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
	Hath heard of great Augustus; Caius Lucius

	He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
	Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
	Is yet fresh in their grief.

	Sir, be patient:

	Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
	He hath against himself.
