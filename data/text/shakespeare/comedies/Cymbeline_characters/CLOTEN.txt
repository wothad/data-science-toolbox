	Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on 't; and then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.

	I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth. A pox on 't! I had rather not be so noble as I am. They dare not fight with me because of the queen my mother. Every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>

	I would this music would come. I am advised to give her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Musicians.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Come on; tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it: and then let her consider.


<SONG>

	Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
	And Phœbus 'gins arise,
	His steeds to water at those springs
	On chalic'd flowers that lies,
	And winking Mary-buds begin
	To ope their golden eyes:
	With every thing that pretty is,
	My lady sweet, arise.
	Arise, arise!
</SONG>


	So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can never amend.

	I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up so early; he cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.

	I know her women are about her. What
	If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
	Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes

	Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
	Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
	Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What

	One of her women lawyer to me, for
	I yet not understand the case myself.

	You sin against
	Obedience, which you owe your father. For
	The contract you pretend with that base wretch,

	With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none;
	And though it be allow'd in meaner parties—
	Yet who than he more mean?—to knit their souls—
	On whom there is no more dependancy
	But brats and beggary—in self-figur'd knot;
	Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
	The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
	The precious note of it with a base slave,
	A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
	A pantler, not so eminent.

	There be many Cæsars

<CLOTEN>	<37%>
	Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Cæsars; other of them may have crooked noses, but to owe such straight arms, none.

	We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan; I do not say I am one, but I have a hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If Cæsar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

	I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,

	Disdaining me and throwing favours on
	The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
	That what's else rare is chok'd, and in that point
	I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
	To be reveng'd upon her. For, when fools
	Shall—

<CLOTEN>	<52%>
	Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter
	I will not ask again. Close villain,
	I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
	Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
	From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
	A dram of worth be drawn.

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
<CLOTEN>	<53%>
	It is Posthumus' hand; I know 't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is, what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly, I would think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
</CLOTEN>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<CLOTEN>	<53%>
	Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?

	Meet thee at Milford-Haven!—I forgot to ask him one thing; I'll remember 't anon,—even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time,—the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart,—that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined,—which, as I say, to vex her, I will execute in the clothes that she so praised,—to the court I'll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my revenge.

</CLOTEN>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
<CLOTEN>	<54%>
	Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded thee: the third is, that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford; would I had wings to follow it!
	Come, and be true.
</CLOTEN>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 1><58%>
<CLOTEN>	<58%>
	I am near to the place where they should meet, if Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the rather,—saving reverence of the word,—for 'tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself,—for it is not vain-glory, for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber,—I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions; yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy mistress enforced, thy garments cut to pieces before thy face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage, but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe; out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is the very description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not deceive me.
