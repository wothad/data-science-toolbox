	A worthy fellow,

	According to the honour of his sender;

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><37%>
<CYMBELINE>	<38%>
	You must know,
	Till the injurious Romans did extort
	This tribute from us, we were free; Cæsar's ambition—
	Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
	The sides o' the world—against all colour here
	Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
	Becomes a war-like people, whom we reckon
	Ourselves to be. We do say then to Cæsar
	Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
	Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar
	Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
	Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
	Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
	Who was the first of Britain which did put
	His brows within a golden crown, and call'd
	Himself a king.

	Thou art welcome, Caius.
	Thy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent

	Which he, to seek of me again, perforce,
	Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
	That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
	Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
	Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
	So Cæsar shall not find them.

	Our expectation that it would be thus

	A thing more made of malice than of duty:

	Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
	When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
	So needful for this present: it strikes me, past

	Set on there. Never was a war did cease,
