	There might have been,

	No, madam; for so long

	How! of adultery! Wherefore write you not
	What monster's her accuser? Leonatus!
	O master! what a strange infection
	Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian—
	As poisonous-tongu'd as handed—hath prevail'd
	On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
	She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
	More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
	As would take in some virtue. O my master!
	Thy mind to her is now as low as were
	Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
	Upon the love and truth and vows which I
	Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
	If it be so to do good service, never
	Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
	That I should seem to lack humanity
	So much as this fact comes to?—Do't: the letter
	That I have sent her by her own command
	Shall give thee opportunity:—O damn'd paper!
	Black as the ink that's on thee. Senseless bauble,
	Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
	So virgin-like without? Lo! here she comes.
	I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><39%>
<PISANIO>	<39%>
	Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><40%>
<PISANIO>	<41%>
	One score 'twixt sun and sun,
	Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><40%>
<PISANIO>	<41%>
	Madam, you're best consider.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<PISANIO>	<45%>
	Please you, read;
	And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
	The most disdain'd of fortune.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<PISANIO>	<45%>
	What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
	Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
	Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
	Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
	Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
	All corners of the world; kings, queens, and states,
	Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
	This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<PISANIO>	<45%>
	Alas! good lady.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<PISANIO>	<46%>
	Good madam, hear me.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<PISANIO>	<46%>
	Hence, vile instrument!
	Thou shalt not damn my hand.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<PISANIO>	<47%>
	O, gracious lady!
	Since I receiv'd command to do this business
	I have not slept one wink.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<PISANIO>	<47%>
	I'll wake mine eyeballs blind first.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<PISANIO>	<47%>
	But to win time
	To lose so bad employment, in the which
	I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
	Hear me with patience.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<47%>
	Then, madam,
	I thought you would not back again.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<47%>
	Not so, neither;
	But if I were as wise as honest, then
	My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
	But that my master is abus'd; some villain,
	Some villain, ay, and singular in his art,
	Hath done you both this cursed injury.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<48%>
	No, on my life.
	I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
	Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
	I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
	And that will well confirm it.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<48%>
	If you'll back to the court,—
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<48%>
	If not at court,
	Then not in Britain must you bide.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<PISANIO>	<48%>
	I am most glad
	You think of other place. The ambassador,
	Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
	To-morrow; now, if you could wear a mind
	Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
	That which, t' appear itself, must not yet be
	But by self-danger, you should tread a course
	Pretty, and full of view; yea, haply, near
	The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
	That though his actions were not visible, yet
	Report should render him hourly to your ear
	As truly as he moves.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<PISANIO>	<49%>
	Well, then, here's the point:
	You must forget to be a woman; change
	Command into obedience; fear and niceness—
	The handmaids of all women, or more truly
	Woman it pretty self—into a waggish courage;
	Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and
	As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
	Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
	Exposing it—but, O! the harder heart,
	Alack! no remedy—to the greedy touch
	Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
	Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
	You made great Juno angry.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<PISANIO>	<49%>
	First, make yourself but like one.
	Forethinking this, I have already fit—
	'Tis in my cloak-bag—doublet, hat, hose, all
	That answer to them; would you in their serving,
	And with what imitation you can borrow
	From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
	Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
	Wherein you are happy,—which you'll make him know,
	If that his head have ear in music,—doubtless
	With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable,
	And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
	You have me, rich; and I will never fail
	Beginning nor supplyment.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 4><49%>
<PISANIO>	<49%>
	Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
	Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
	Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
	Here is a box, I had it from the queen,
	What's in 't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
	Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
	Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
	And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
	Direct you to the best!
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 5><51%>
<PISANIO>	<52%>
	O! good my lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
	Alas! my lord,
	How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?
	He is in Rome.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
	O! my all-worthy lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
	Then, sir,
	This paper is the history of my knowledge
	Touching her flight.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 5><52%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Or this, or perish.
	She's far enough; and what he learns by this
	May prove his travel, not her danger.

<STAGE DIR>

<PISANIO>	<53%>
	Sir, as I think.

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
	Well, my good lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<PISANIO>	<53%>
	Sir, I will.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<PISANIO>	<54%>
	I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<PISANIO>	<54%>
	I shall, my lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<PISANIO>	<54%>
	Ay, my noble lord.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
<PISANIO>	<54%>
	She can scarce be there yet.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
<PISANIO>	<55%>
	Thou bidd'st me to my loss; for true to thee
	Were to prove false, which I will never be,
	To him that is most true. To Milford go,
	And find not her whom thou pursu'st. Flow, flow,
	You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
	Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<PISANIO>	<72%>
	Sir, my life is yours,
	I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
	I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
	Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
	Hold me your loyal servant.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
<PISANIO>	<73%>
	I heard no letter from my master since
	I wrote him Imogen was slain; 'tis strange;
	Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
	To yield me often tidings; neither know I
	What is betid to Cloten; but remain
	Perplex'd in all: the heavens still must work.
	Wherein I am false I am honest; not true to be true:
	These present wars shall find I love my country,
	Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
	All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd;
	Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 5><85%>
<PISANIO>	<86%>
	He hath been search'd among the dead and living,

<PISANIO>	<92%>
	O, gentlemen, help!

	Wake, my mistress!
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>

	How fares my mistress?
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 5><92%>
<PISANIO>	<93%>
	Lady,
	The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
	That box I gave you was not thought by me
	A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
</PISANIO>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<PISANIO>	<94%>
	My lord,
	Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
	Upon my lady's missing, came to me
	With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore
	If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
	It was my instant death. By accident,
	I had a feigned letter of my master's
	Then in my pocket, which directed him
	To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
	Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
	Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts
	With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
	My lady's honour; what became of him
	I further know not.
