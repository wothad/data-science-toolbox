<LORD 1>	<6%>
	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<LORD 1>	<6%>
	Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<LORD 1>	<6%>
	Stand you! You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having, gave you some ground.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<LORD 1>	<7%>
	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<LORD 1>	<7%>
	I'll attend your lordship.
</LORD 1>

<LORD 1>	<22%>
	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LORD 1>	<23%>
	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LORD 1>	<23%>
	There's an Italian come; and 'tis thought, one of Leonatus' friends.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LORD 1>	<23%>
	One of your lordship's pages.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LORD 1>	<23%>
	You cannot derogate, my lord.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><25%>
<LORD 1>	<26%>
	Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><25%>
<LORD 1>	<26%>
	But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><26%>
<LORD 1>	<26%>
	Day, my lord.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
<LORD 1>	<72%>
	Good my liege,
	The day that she was missing he was here;
	I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
	All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
	There wants no diligence in seeking him,
	And will, no doubt, be found.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
<LORD 1>	<72%>
	So please-your majesty,
	The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
	Are landed on your coast, with a supply
	Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
</LORD 1>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>
<LORD 1>	<72%>
	Good my liege,
	Your preparation can affront no less
	Than what you hear of; come more, for more you're ready:
	The want is, but to put those powers in motion
	That long to move.
</LORD 1>
