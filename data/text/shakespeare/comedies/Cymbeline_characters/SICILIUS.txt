	No more, thou thunder-master, show
	Thy spite on mortal flies:
	With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
	That thy adulteries
	Rates and revenges.
	Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
	Whose face I never saw?
	I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
	Attending nature's law:
	Whose father then—as men report,
	Thou orphans' father art—
	Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
	From this earth-vexing smart.

	Great nature, like his ancestry,
	Moulded the stuff so fair,
	That he deserv'd the praise o' the world,
	As great Sicilius' heir.

<SICILIUS>	<82%>

	Why did you suffer Iachimo,
	Slight thing of Italy,
	To taint his nobler heart and brain
	With needless jealousy;
	And to become the geck and scorn
	O' the other's villany?

<SICILIUS>	<82%>

	Thy crystal window ope; look out;
	No longer exercise
	Upon a valiant race thy harsh
	And potent injuries.

<SICILIUS>	<82%>

	Peep through thy marble mansion; help!
	Or we poor ghosts will cry
	To the shining synod of the rest
	Against thy deity.

	He came in thunder; his celestial breath
	Was sulphurous to smell; the holy eagle
	Stoop'd, as to foot us; his ascension is
	More sweet than our bless'd fields; his royal bird
	Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
	As when his god is pleas'd.
</SICILIUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 4><82%>
<SICILIUS>	<83%>
	The marble pavement closes; he is enter'd
	His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
	Let us with care perform his great behest.
