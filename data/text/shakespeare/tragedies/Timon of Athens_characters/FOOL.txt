<FOOL>	<28%>
	She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!

	Look you, here comes my mistress' page.

	Are you three usurers' men?
</FOOL>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<FOOL>	<29%>
	I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?

<FOOL>	<30%>
	A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a spirit: sometime 't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher, with two stones more than 's artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and generally in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.

<FOOL>	<30%>
	Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lackest.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<FOOL>	<30%>
	I do not always follow lover, elder brother and woman; sometime the philosopher.
