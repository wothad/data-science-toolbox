<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	Ay, and I think
	One business does command us all; for mine
	Is money.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	And Sir Philotus too!
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	Welcome, good brother.
	What do you think the hour?
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 4><44%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	So much?
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	Not yet.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<44%>
	Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him:
	You must consider that a prodigal course
	Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
	I fear,
	'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
	That is, one may reach deep enough, and yet
	Find little.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<45%>
	Mark, how strange it shows,
	Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
	And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
	And send for money for 'em.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 4><45%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<45%>
	Five thousand mine.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<45%>
	Flaminius! Sir, a word. Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<46%>
	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
	He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<46%>
	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<47%>
	Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
	And, if it be so far beyond his health,
	Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
	And make a clear way to the gods.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<48%>
	Put in now, Titus.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<48%>
	Here's mine.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<48%>
	Alas! my lord,—
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 4><48%>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>	<48%>
	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
</LUCIUS' SERVANT>
