<LORD 2>	<11%>
	Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LORD 2>	<11%>
	Fare thee well, fare thee well.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LORD 2>	<12%>
	Why, Apemantus?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LORD 2>	<12%>
	Away, unpeaceable dog! or I'll spurn thee hence.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LORD 2>	<12%>
	He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
	Is but his steward: no meed but he repays
	Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
	But breeds the giver a return exceeding
	All use of quittance.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LORD 2>	<12%>
	Long may he live in fortunes!
	Shall we in?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<LORD 2>	<15%>
	Let it flow this way, my good lord.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
<LORD 2>	<17%>
	Joy had the like conception in our eyes,
	And, at that instant, like a babe, sprung up.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><20%>
<LORD 2>	<20%>
	Our horses!

</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<LORD 2>	<22%>
	With more than common thanks I will receive it.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<LORD 2>	<22%>
	So infinitely endear'd,—
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 6><54%>
<LORD 2>	<54%>
	I also wish it you. I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 6><54%>
<LORD 2>	<54%>
	It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 6><55%>
<LORD 2>	<54%>
	In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 6><55%>
<LORD 2>	<54%>
	Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed you?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 6><55%>
<LORD 2>	<55%>
	A thousand pieces!
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 6><55%>
<LORD 2>	<55%>
	The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
<LORD 2>	<55%>
	My noble lord,—
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
<LORD 2>	<55%>
	My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame, that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
<LORD 2>	<55%>
	If you had sent but two hours before,—
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
<LORD 2>	<56%>
	All covered dishes!
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 6><56%>
<LORD 2>	<56%>
	Alcibiades banished!
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
<LORD 2>	<56%>
	I pray you, upon what?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
<LORD 2>	<56%>
	This is the old man still.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 6><57%>
<LORD 2>	<56%>
	It does; but time will—and so—
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
<LORD 2>	<58%>
	Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
<LORD 2>	<58%>
	Here 'tis.
</LORD 2>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
<LORD 2>	<59%>
	Lord Timon's mad.
</LORD 2>
