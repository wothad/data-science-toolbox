<SPEECH 35><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<APEMANTUS>	<14%>
	No,
	You shall not make me welcome:
	I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<APEMANTUS>	<14%>
	Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon:
	I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<APEMANTUS>	<14%>
	I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
	Ne'er flatter thee. O you gods! what a number
	Of men eat Timon, and he sees them not.
	It grieves me to see so many dip their meat
	In one man's blood; and all the madness is,
	He cheers them up too.
	I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
	Methinks they should invite them without knives;
	Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
	There's much example for't; the fellow that
	Sits next him now, parts bread with him, and pledges
	The breath of him in a divided draught,
	Is the readiest man to kill him: 't has been prov'd.
	If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
	Lest they should spy my wind-pipe's dangerous notes:
	Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 1><SCENE 2><15%>
<APEMANTUS>	<15%>
	Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
	Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner,
	Honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
	This and my food are equals, there's no odds:
	Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.

	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
	I pray for no man but myself:
	Grant I may never prove so fond,
	To trust man on his oath or bond;
	Or a harlot for her weeping;
	Or a dog that seems a-sleeping;
	Or a keeper with my freedom;
	Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
	Amen. So fall to't:
	Rich men sin, and I eat root.

<STAGE DIR>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>

	'Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
<APEMANTUS>	<17%>
	Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
<APEMANTUS>	<17%>
	Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 2><17%>
<APEMANTUS>	<17%>
	Much!
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 2><18%>
<APEMANTUS>	<18%>
	Hoy-day! what a sweep of vanity comes this way:
	They dance! they are mad women.
	Like madness is the glory of this life,
	As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
	We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;
	And spend our flatteries to drink those men
	Upon whose age we void it up again,
	With poisonous spite and envy.
	Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
	Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
	Of their friend's gift?
	I should fear those that dance before me now
	Would one day stamp upon me: it has been done;
	Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

</APEMANTUS>

	Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold taking, I doubt me.

<APEMANTUS>	<23%>
	What a coil's here!
	Serving of becks and jutting out of bums!
	I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
	That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
	Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs.
	Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
<APEMANTUS>	<23%>
	No, I'll nothing; for if I should be bribed too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps, and vain-glories?
</APEMANTUS>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
<APEMANTUS>	<23%>
	So:
	Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then;

<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<APEMANTUS>	<71%>
	This is in thee a nature but infected;
	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
	Hug their diseas'd perfumes, and have forgot
	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
	By putting on the cunning of a carper.
	Be thou a flatterer now, and seak to thrive
	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
	And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
	Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bid welcome,
	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
	Rascals should have't. Do not assume my likeness.

<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 3><72%>

	Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;

	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
	That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels
	And skip when thou point'st out? will the cold brook,
	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste
	To cure the o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
	Whose naked natures live in all the spite
	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks
	To the conflicting elements expos'd,
	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
	O! thou shalt find—

	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on

	The one is filling still, never complete;
	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
	Worse than the worst, content.
	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for thee; eat it.
