	Noble Ventidius! Well;

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>

	Painting is welcome.
	The painting is almost the natural man;

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<TIMON>	<13%>
	O! by no means,
	Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love;
	I gave it freely ever; and there's none
	Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
	If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
	To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 2><13%>
<TIMON>	<13%>
	Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
	To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<TIMON>	<14%>
	O! Apemantus, you are welcome.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>
<TIMON>	<14%>
	Fie! thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there

	They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est;
	But yond man is ever angry.
	Go, let him have a table by himself,

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 2><14%>

	I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian, therefore, welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

	My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.

<SPEECH 45><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>

	Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
<TIMON>	<16%>
	You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 1><SCENE 2><16%>
<TIMON>	<16%>
	O! no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods! think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O! what a precious comfort 'tis, to have so many, like brothers, commanding one another's fortunes. O joy! e'en made away ere it can be born. Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to forget their faults, I drink to you.
</TIMON>

	You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 1><SCENE 2><20%>

	They are fairly welcome.

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>

	I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
	Be worthily entertain'd.

<SPEECH 60><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>
<TIMON>	<21%>
	I'll hunt with him; and let them be receiv'd,

<SPEECH 61><ACT 1><SCENE 2><21%>

	You do yourselves

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<TIMON>	<22%>
	And now I remember, my lord, you gave
	Good words the other day of a bay courser
	I rode on: it is yours, because you lik'd it.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<TIMON>	<22%>
	You may take my word, my lord; I know no man
	Can justly praise but what he does affect:
	I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
	I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<TIMON>	<22%>
	I take all and your several visitations
	So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
	Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
	And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
	Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
	It comes in charity to thee; for all thy living
	Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
	Lie in a pitch'd field.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 1><SCENE 2><22%>
<TIMON>	<22%>
	And so
	Am I to you.

<SPEECH 69><ACT 1><SCENE 2><23%>
<TIMON>	<23%>
	Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come with better music.

<SPEECH 70><ACT 2><SCENE 2><26%>

	So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,

</TIMON>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<TIMON>	<31%>
	Go to:

<SPEECH 83><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<TIMON>	<32%>
	Come, sermon me no further;
	No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;

	Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
	To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
	If I would broach the vessels of my love,
	And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
	Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
	As I can bid thee speak.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<TIMON>	<33%>
	And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,

	Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place: sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.—
	You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves praised: but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods! the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.

	Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
	Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
	And minister in their steads! To general filths
	Convert, o'the instant, green virginity!
	Do't in your parents' eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast;
	Rather than render back, out with your knives,
	And cut your trusters' throats! Bound servants, steal!—
	Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,—
	And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
	Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
	Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire,
	With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
	Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
	Domestic awe, night-rest and neighbourhood,
	Instruction, manners, mysteries and trades,
	Degrees, observances, customs and laws,
	Decline to your confounding contraries,
	And let confusion live! Plagues incident to men,
	Your potent and infectious fevers heap
	On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
	Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
	As lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty
	Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
	That'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
	And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
	Sow all the Athenian bosoms, and their crop
	Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
	That their society, as their friendship, may
	Be merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee
	But nakedness, thou detestable town!
	Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
	Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
	The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
	The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all—
	The Athenians both within and out that wall!

	Raise me this beggar, and deny't that lord;

	The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
	From general excrement, each thing's a thief;
	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
	Have uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves; away!
	Rob one another. There's more gold: cut throats;
	All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
	Break open shops; nothing can you steal
	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!
	Amen.

	Away! what art thou?
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 178><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<TIMON>	<83%>
	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 179><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<TIMON>	<83%>
	Then I know thee not:
	I never had an honest man about me; ay all
	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 180><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<TIMON>	<83%>
	What! dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,
	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give,
	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 181><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<TIMON>	<83%>
	Had I a steward
	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
	Was born of woman.
	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
	You perpetual sober gods! I do proclaim
	One honest man, mistake me not, but one;
	No more, I pray, and he's a steward.
	How fain would I have hated all mankind!
	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
	I fell with curses.
	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
	For, by oppressing and betraying me,
	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
	For many so arrive at second masters
	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,—
	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure,—
	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
	If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts,
	Expecting in return twenty for one?
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 182><ACT 4><SCENE 3><84%>
<TIMON>	<84%>
	Look thee, 'tis so. Thou singly honest man,
	Here, take: the gods out of my misery,
	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
	And so, farewell and thrive.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 183><ACT 4><SCENE 3><85%>
<TIMON>	<85%>
	If thou hatest
	Curses, stay not; fly, whilst thou'rt bless'd and free:
	Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

<TIMON>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 186><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<TIMON>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,
	That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
	Than where swine feed!
	'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
	Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
	To thee be worship; and thy saints for aye
	Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey.
	Fit I meet them.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 187><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<TIMON>	<87%>
	Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 188><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<88%>
	Let it go naked, men may see 't the better:
	You, that are honest, by being what you are,
	Make them best seen and known.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 189><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<88%>
	Ay, you are honest men.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 190><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<88%>
	Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
	Can you eat roots and drink cold water? no.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 191><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<88%>
	Ye're honest men. Ye've heard that I have gold;
	I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 192><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<88%>
	Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
	Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
	Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 193><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
	Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
	That thou art even natural in thine art.
	But for all this, my honest-natur'd friends,
	I must needs say you have a little fault:
	Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
	You take much pains to mend.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 194><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	You'll take it ill.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 195><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	Will you indeed?
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 196><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,
	That mightily deceives you.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 197><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
	Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
	Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur'd
	That he's a made-up villain.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 198><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
	Rid me these villains from your companies:
	Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
	Confound them by some course, and come to me,
	I'll give you gold enough.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 199><ACT 5><SCENE 1><89%>
<TIMON>	<89%>
	You that way and you this, but two in company;
	Each man apart, all single and alone,
	Yet an arch villain keeps him company.
	If, where thou art two villains shall not be,
	Come not near him. <STAGE DIR>
<To the Poet.>
</STAGE DIR> If thou would not reside
	But where one villain is, then him abandon.
	Hence! pack! there's gold; ye came for gold, ye slaves:
	You have done work for me, there's payment: hence!
	You are an alchemist, make gold of that.
	Out, rascal dogs!
<STAGE DIR>

	Thousun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and be hang'd:
	For each true word, a blister! and each false
	Be as a cauterizing to the root o'the tongue,
	Consuming it with speaking!
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 201><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>

	Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 202><ACT 5><SCENE 1><91%>
<TIMON>	<91%>
	I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
	Could I but catch it for them.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 203><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<TIMON>	<92%>
	You witch me in it;
	Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
	Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
	And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 204><ACT 5><SCENE 1><92%>
<TIMON>	<92%>
	Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:—
	If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
	Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
	That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,
	And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
	Giving our holy virgins to the stain
	Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war;
	Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
	In pity of our aged and our youth
	I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
	And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not
	While you have throats to answer: for myself,
	There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
	But I do prize it at my love before
	The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
	To the protection of the prosperous gods,
	As thieves to keepers.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 205><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<TIMON>	<93%>
	Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
	It will be seen to-morrow. My long sickness
	Of health and living now begins to mend,
	And nothing brings me all things. Go; live still:
	Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
	And last so long enough!
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 206><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<TIMON>	<93%>
	But yet I love my country, and am not
	One that rejoices in the common wrack,
	As common bruit doth put it.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 207><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<TIMON>	<93%>
	Commend me to my loving countrymen,—
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 208><ACT 5><SCENE 1><93%>
<TIMON>	<93%>
	Commend me to them;
	And tell them, that, to ease them of their griefs,
	Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
	Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
	That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
	In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
	I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 209><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<TIMON>	<94%>
	I have a tree which grows here in my close,
	That mine own use invites me to cut down,
	And shortly must I fell it; tell my friends,
	Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,
	From high to low throughout, that whoso please
	To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
	Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
	And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
</TIMON>

<SPEECH 210><ACT 5><SCENE 1><94%>
<TIMON>	<94%>
	Come not to me again; but say to Athans,
	Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
	Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
	Who once a day with his embossed froth
	The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
	And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
	Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
	What is amiss plague and infection mend!
	Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
	Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
</TIMON>
