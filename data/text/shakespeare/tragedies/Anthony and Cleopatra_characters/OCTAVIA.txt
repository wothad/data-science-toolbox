	All which time
	Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
	To them for you.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 3><25%>
<OCTAVIA>	<26%>
	Good night, sir.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
<OCTAVIA>	<43%>
	My noble brother!
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
<OCTAVIA>	<43%>
	Sir, look well to my husband's house; and—
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><43%>
<OCTAVIA>	<43%>
	I'll tell you in your ear.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 4><46%>
<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
	O my good lord!
	Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
	Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
	If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
	Praying for both parts:
	The good gods will mock me presently,
	When I shall pray, 'O! bless my lord and husband;'
	Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
	'O! bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
	Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
	'Twixt these extremes at all.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 4><47%>
<OCTAVIA>	<46%>
	Thanks to my lord.
	The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
	Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
	As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
	Should solder up the rift.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 6><49%>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Hail, Cæsar, and my lord! hail, most dear Cæsar!
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 6><49%>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 6><49%>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Good my lord,
	To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
	On my free-will. My lord, Mark Antony,
	Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
	My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
	His pardon for return.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 6><50%>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	Do not say so, my lord.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 6><50%>
<OCTAVIA>	<49%>
	My lord, in Athens.
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 6><50%>
<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
	Ay me, most wretched,
	That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
	That do afflict each other!
</OCTAVIA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 6><51%>
<OCTAVIA>	<50%>
	Is it so, sir?
</OCTAVIA>
