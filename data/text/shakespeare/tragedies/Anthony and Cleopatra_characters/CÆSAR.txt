	You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
	It is not Cæsar's natural vice to hate
	Our great competitor. From Alexandria
	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
	The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
	Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
	Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
	A man who is the abstract of all faults
	That all men follow.

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>

	You are too indulgent. Let us grant it is not
	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
	To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
	To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
	With knaves that smell of sweat; say this becomes him,—
	As his composure must be rare indeed
	Whom these things cannot blemish,—yet must Antony
	No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
	So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
	His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
	Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
	Call on him for 't; but to confound such time
	That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
	As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid
	As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
	Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
	And so rebel to judgment.

	I should have known no less.
	It hath been taught us from the primal state,
	That he which is was wish'd until he were;
	And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
	Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
	Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
	Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
	To rot itself with motion.

	Antony,
	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
	Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
	Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
	Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
	Though daintily brought up, with patience more
	Than savages could suffer; thou didst drink
	The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
	Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign
	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
	Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
	The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
	Which some did die to look on; and all this—
	It wounds thy honour that I speak it now—
	Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
	So much as lank'd not.

	Cæsarion, whom they call my father's son,

	Since then hath made between them. Unto her

	Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
	Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust

	Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
	A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented

	How calm and gentle I proceeded still
	In all my writings. Go with me, and see
	What I can show in this.

	Which is the Queen of Egypt?
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<CÆSAR>	<92%>
	Arise, you shall not kneel.
	I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<CÆSAR>	<92%>
	Take to you no hard thoughts;
	The record of what injuries you did us,
	Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
	As things but done by chance.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<CÆSAR>	<92%>
	Cleopatra, know,
	We will extenuate rather than enforce:
	If you apply yourself to our intents,—
	Which towards you are most gentle,—you shall find
	A benefit in this change; but if you seek
	To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
	Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
	Of my good purposes, and put your children
	To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
	If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<CÆSAR>	<92%>
	You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<CÆSAR>	<93%>
	Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
	Your wisdom in the deed.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<CÆSAR>	<93%>
	Good queen, let us entreat you.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<CÆSAR>	<94%>
	Forbear, Seleucus.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<CÆSAR>	<94%>
	Cleopatra,
	Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
	Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be 't yours,
	Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
	Cæsar's no merchant, to make prize with you
	Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
	Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
	For we intend so to dispose you as
	Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
	Our care and pity is so much upon you,
	That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<CÆSAR>	<94%>
	Not so. Adieu.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	Bravest at the last,
	She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
	Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
	I do not see them bleed.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 96><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	Poison'd then.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 97><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<CÆSAR>	<99%>
	O noble weakness!
	If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
	By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
	As she would catch another Antony
	In her strong toil of grace.
</CÆSAR>

<SPEECH 98><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<CÆSAR>	<100%>
	Most probable
	That so she died; for her physician tells me
	She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
	Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
	And bear her women from the monument.
	She shall be buried by her Antony:
	No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
	A pair so famous. High events as these
	Strike those that make them; and their story is
	No less in pity than his glory which
	Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall,
	In solemn show, attend this funeral,
	And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
	High order in this great solemnity.
</CÆSAR>
