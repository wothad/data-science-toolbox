	O noble emperor! do not fight by sea;
	Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
	This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
	And the Phœnicians go a-ducking; we
	Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
	And fighting foot to foot.

	You keep by land

	Hadst thou done so,

	Who!
	One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,

	Enobarbus, Antony
	Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with

	Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
	Unloading of his mules.

<SOLDIER>	<71%>
	Mock not, Enobarbus.
	I tell you true: best you saf'd the bringer
	Out of the host; I must attend mine office
	Or would have done 't myself. Your emperor
	Continues still a Jove.
