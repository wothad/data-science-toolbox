	Nay, hear them, Antony:
	Fulvia, perchance, is angry; or, who knows
	If the scarce-bearded Cæsar have not sent
	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<1%>
	Perchance! nay, and most like;
	You must not stay here longer; your dismission
	Is come from Cæsar; therefore hear it, Antony.
	Where's Fulvia's process? Cæsar's I would say? both?
	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
	Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine

	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,

	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
	Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
	For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
	With most delicious poison. Think on me,
	That am with Phœbus' amorous pinches black,
	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Cæsar,
	When thou wast here above the ground I was
	A morsel for a monarch, and great Pompey
	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
	There would he anchor his aspect and die
	With looking on his life.

</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<15%>
	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!

	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>

	Mine ear must pluck it thence.

<SPEECH 42><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>

	What! was he sad or merry?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 1><SCENE 5><15%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<16%>
	O well-divided disposition! Note him,
	Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
	He was not sad, for he would shire on those
	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
	The violence of either thee becomes,
	So does it no man else. Mett'st thou my posts?

	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 5><28%>

	That time—O times!—

	Well, go to, I will;

	There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas

	Farewell, and thanks.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Dolabella.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
	Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shall be shown
	In Rome, as well as I; mechanic slaves
	With greasy aprons, rules and hammers, shall
	Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
	Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
	And forc'd to drink their vapour.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 189><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<95%>
	Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
	Will catch at us, like strumpets, and scald rimers
	Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
	Extemporally will stage us, and present
	Our Alexandrian revels. Antony
	Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
	Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
	I' the posture of a whore.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 190><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<95%>
	Nay, that's certain.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 191><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<95%>
	Why, that's the way
	To fool their preparation, and to conquer
	Their most absurd intents.

<STAGE DIR>
<Re-enter Charmian.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, Charmian,
	Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch
	My best attires; I am again for Cydnus,
	To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.
	Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
	And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
	To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Iras. A noise heard.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Wherefore's this noise?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 192><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
	Let him come in. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Guard.>
</STAGE DIR> What poor an instrument
	May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
	My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
	Of woman in me; now from head to foot
	I am marble-constant, now the fleeting moon
	No planet is of mine.

</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 193><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
	Avoid, and leave him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Guard.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
	That kills and pains not?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 194><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
	Remember'st thou any that have died on 't?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 195><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<96%>
	Get thee hence; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 196><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 197><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Ay, ay; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 198><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 199><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Will it eat me?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 200><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Well, get thee gone; farewell.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 201><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<97%>
	Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
	Immortal longings in me; now no more
	The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
	Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
	Antony call; I see him rouse himself
	To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
	The luck of Cæsar, which the gods give men
	To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
	Now to that name my courage prove my title!
	I am fire, and air; my other elements
	I give to baser life. So; have you done?
	Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
	Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
	If thou and nature can so gently part,
	The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
	Which hurts, and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
	If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
	It is not worth leave-taking.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 202><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	This proves me base:
	If she first meet the curled Antony,
	He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
	Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
<STAGE DIR>
<To the asp, which she applies to her breast.>
</STAGE DIR>
	With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
	Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,
	Be angry, and dispatch. O! couldst thou speak,
	That I might hear thee call great Cæsar ass
	Unpolicied.
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 203><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	Peace, peace!
	Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
	That sucks the nurse asleep?
</CLEOPATRA>

<SPEECH 204><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<CLEOPATRA>	<98%>
	As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,—
	O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
<STAGE DIR>
<Applying another asp to her arm.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What should I stay—
</CLEOPATRA>
