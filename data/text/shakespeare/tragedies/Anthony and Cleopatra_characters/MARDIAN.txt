	What 's your highness' pleasure?
</MARDIAN>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<MARDIAN>	<15%>
	Yes, gracious madam.
</MARDIAN>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<MARDIAN>	<15%>
	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
	But what in deed is honest to be done;
	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
	What Venus did with Mars.
</MARDIAN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 5><27%>
<MARDIAN>	<28%>
	As well as I can, madam.

	No, Antony;
	My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
	With thine entirely.

<MARDIAN>	<78%>
	Death of one person can be paid but once,
	And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
	Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake
	Was, 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
	Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
	The name of Antony; it was divided
	Between her heart and lips. She render'd life,
	Thy name so buried in her.
</MARDIAN>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE XII.— ><79%>
<MARDIAN>	<79%>
	Dead.
</MARDIAN>
