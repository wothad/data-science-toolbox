	Ay:
	But soon that war had end, and the time's state
	Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Cæsar,
	Whose better issue in the war, from Italy
	Upon the first encounter drave them.

	Labienus—
	This is stiff news—hath, with his Parthian force
	Extended Asia; from Euphrates
	His conquering banner shook from Syria
	To Lydia and to Ionia: whilst—
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>
<MESSENGER>	<5%>
	O! my lord.
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><5%>

	At your noble pleasure.
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
<MESSENGER>	<13%>
	Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
	Most noble Cæsar, shalt thou have report
	How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
	And it appears he is belov'd of those
	That only have fear'd Cæsar; to the ports
	The discontents repair, and men's reports
	Give him much wrong'd.
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<MESSENGER>	<13%>
	Cæsar, I bring thee word,
	Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
	Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
	With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
	They make in Italy; the borders maritime
	Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt;
	No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
	Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
	Than could his war resisted.

	But yet, madam,—
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>
<MESSENGER>	<29%>
	Free, madam! no; I made no such report:

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 5><29%>

	Gracious madam,
	I, that do bring the news made not the match.

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 5><30%>
<MESSENGER>	<30%>
	He's married, madam.
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 5><30%>
<MESSENGER>	<30%>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 5><31%>

	Take no offence that I would not offend you;

	She is not, madam.

	Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voic'd.
</MESSENGER>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 3><45%>

	She creeps;
