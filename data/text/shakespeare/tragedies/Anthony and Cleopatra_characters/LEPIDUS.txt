<LEPIDUS>	<12%>
	I must not think there are
	Evils enow to darken all his goodness;
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
	Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
	Than what he chooses.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><12%>
<LEPIDUS>	<13%>
	Here's more news.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	'Tis pity of him.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	To-morrow, Cæsar,
	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
	Both what by sea and land I can be able
	To front this present time.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><14%>
<LEPIDUS>	<14%>
	Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
	To let me be partaker.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<LEPIDUS>	<18%>
	Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
	And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
	To soft and gentle speech.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	'Tis not a time
	For private stomaching.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	But small to greater matters must give way.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	Your speech is passion;
	But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
	The noble Antony.

</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<LEPIDUS>	<19%>
	Noble friends,
	That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
	May it be gently heard; when we debate
	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
	Murder in healing wounds; then, noble partners,—
	The rather for I earnestly beseech,—
	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
	Nor curstness grow to the matter.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><20%>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	Soft, Cæsar!
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	'Tis noble spoken.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><21%>
<LEPIDUS>	<21%>
	Worthily spoken, Mecænas.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><22%>
<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Happily, amen!
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Time calls upon 's:
	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
	Or else he seeks out us.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
<LEPIDUS>	<23%>
	Noble Antony,
	Not sickness should detain me.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
<LEPIDUS>	<27%>
	Trouble yourselves no further; pray you hasten
	Your generals after.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
<LEPIDUS>	<27%>
	Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
	Which will become you both, farewell.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
<LEPIDUS>	<27%>
	Your way is shorter;
	My purposes to draw me much about:
	You 'll win two days upon me.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 4><27%>
<LEPIDUS>	<27%>
	Farewell.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 6><32%>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	Be pleas'd to tell us—
	For this is from the present—how you take
	The offers we have sent you.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	That's our offer.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 6><33%>
<LEPIDUS>	<33%>
	Well met here.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
<LEPIDUS>	<34%>
	Show us the way, sir.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	You've strange serpents there.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without contradiction, I have heard that.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	What colour is it of?
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 7><37%>
<LEPIDUS>	<37%>
	'Tis a strange serpent.
</LEPIDUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><44%>
<LEPIDUS>	<44%>
	Let all the number of the stars give light
	To thy fair way!
</LEPIDUS>
