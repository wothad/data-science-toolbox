	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O! that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands.

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Good sir, give me good fortune.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Pray then, foresee me one.

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><2%>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Cæsar, and companion me with my mistress.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<CHARMIAN>	<3%>
	Then, belike, my children shall have no names; prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<CHARMIAN>	<4%>
	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>

	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>

	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?

	Our worser thoughts heaven mend! Alexas,—come, his fortune, his fortune. O! let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee; and let her die too, and give him a worse; and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>

	No, madam.

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><8%>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><8%>
<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
	Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
	You do not hold the method to enforce

</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><8%>
<CHARMIAN>	<9%>
	In each thing give him way, cross him in nothing.

	Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:

	Why, madam?
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>
<CHARMIAN>	<14%>
	You think of him too much.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 5><14%>

	Madam, I trust, not so.
</CHARMIAN>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>

	O! that brave Cæsar.

<SPEECH 30><ACT 1><SCENE 5><16%>

	'Twas merry when

	A proper man.
