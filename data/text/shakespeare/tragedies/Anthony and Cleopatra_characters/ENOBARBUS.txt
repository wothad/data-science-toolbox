<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><3%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<4%>
	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be,—drunk to bed.

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>

	Hush! here comes Antony.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
	No, lady.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><4%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<5%>
	Madam!
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
	What's your pleasure, sir?
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<6%>
	Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><6%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Alack! sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	O, sir! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Sir?
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Fulvia!
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<7%>
	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
	And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<8%>
	I shall do it.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<18%>
	I shall entreat him
	To answer like himself: if Cæsar move him,
	Let Antony look over Cæsar's head,
	And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
	Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
	I would not shave 't to-day.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<19%>
	Every time

	Not if the small come first.

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><18%>

<ENOBARBUS>	<21%>
	Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	This was but as a fly by an eagle; we had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 2><23%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	I will tell you.
	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
	Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
	Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that
	The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
	The water which they beat to follow faster,
	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
	It beggar'd all description; she did lie
	In her pavilion,—cloth-of-gold of tissue,—
	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
	The fancy outwork nature; on each side her
	Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
	And what they undid did.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<24%>
	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
	And made their bends adornings; at the helm
	A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle
	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
	Her people out upon her, and Antony,
	Enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
	And made a gap in nature.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 2><24%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
	Invited her to supper; she replied
	It should be better he became her guest,
	Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
	And, for his ordinary pays his heart
	For what his eyes eat only.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	I saw her once
	Hop forty paces through the public street;
	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted
	That she did make defect perfection,
	And, breathless, power breathe forth.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<25%>
	Never; he will not:
	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
	Her infinite variety; other women cloy
	The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
	Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
	Bless her when she is riggish.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 2><25%>

	You have done well by water.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<34%>
	I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	Yes, something you can deny for your own safety; you have been a great thief by sea.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 6><34%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>

	'Tis true.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	I think so too; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 6><35%>
<ENOBARBUS>	<35%>
	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then, shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Cæsar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.
</ENOBARBUS>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 6><36%>

	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
	Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
	A diminution in our captain's brain
	Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason
	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
	Some way to leave him.

	What mean you, sir,

	Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
	Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
	Great Herod to incline himself to Cæsar,
	And leave his master Antony: for this pains
	Cæsar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
	That fell away have entertainment, but
	No honourable trust. I have done ill,
	Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
	That I will joy no more.

	I am alone the villain of the earth,
	And feel I am so most. O Antony!
	Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
	My better service, when my turpitude
	Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
	If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
	Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do 't, I feel.
	I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
	Some ditch, wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
	My latter part of life.

	O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
	The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
	That life, a very rebel to my will,
	May hang no longer on me; throw my heart
	Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
	Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
	And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony!
	Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
	Forgive me in thine own particular;
	But let the world rank me in register
	A master-leaver and a fugitive.
	O Antony! O Antony!
