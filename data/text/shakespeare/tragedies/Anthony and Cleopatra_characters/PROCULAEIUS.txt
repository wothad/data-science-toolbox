<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
	Cæsar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
	And bids thee study on what fair demands
	Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
</PROCULAEIUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
	My name is Proculeius.

<PROCULAEIUS>	<88%>
	Be of good cheer;
	You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing.
	Make your full reference freely to my lord,
	Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
	On all that need; let me report to him
	Your sweet dependancy, and you shall find
	A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
	Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
</PROCULAEIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<89%>
	This I'll report, dear lady:
	Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
	Of him that caus'd it.

<PROCULAEIUS>	<89%>
	Hold, worthy lady, hold!
<STAGE DIR>
<Seizes and disarms her.>

<PROCULAEIUS>	<89%>
	Cleopatra,
	Do not abuse my master's bounty by
	The undoing of yourself; let the world see
	His nobleness well acted, which your death
	Will never let come forth.
</PROCULAEIUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<90%>
	O! temperance, lady.
</PROCULAEIUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<90%>
	You do extend
	These thoughts of horror further than you shall
	Find cause in Cæsar.

</PROCULAEIUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<PROCULAEIUS>	<90%>
	So, Dolabella,
	It shall content me best; be gentle to her.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Cleopatra.>
</STAGE DIR> To Cæsar I will speak what you shall please,
	If you'll employ me to him.
</PROCULAEIUS>
