	Such as I am, I come from Antony:
	I was of late as petty to his ends
	As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
	To his grand sea.

	Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
	Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
	He lessens his requests, and to thee sues
	To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
	A private man in Athens; this for him.
	Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
	Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
	The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
	Now hazarded to thy grace.
</EUPHRONIUS>

<EUPHRONIUS>	<58%>
	Fortune pursue thee!
</EUPHRONIUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><59%>
<EUPHRONIUS>	<59%>
	Ay, my lord.
</EUPHRONIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE XI.— ><59%>
<EUPHRONIUS>	<59%>
	He says so.
</EUPHRONIUS>
