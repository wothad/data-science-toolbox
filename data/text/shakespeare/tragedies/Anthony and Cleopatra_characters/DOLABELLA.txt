	Cæsar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
	An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
	He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
	Which had superfluous kings for messengers
	Not many moons gone by.

	Proculeius,
	What thou hast done thy master Cæsar knows,
	And he hath sent for thee; as for the queen,
	I'll take her to my guard.

<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
	Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
	Assuredly you know me.
</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<DOLABELLA>	<90%>
	I understand not, madam.

	If it might please ye,—

	Gentle madam, no.
</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>
	Hear me, good madam.
	Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
	As answering to the weight: would I might never
	O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
	By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
	My very heart at root.
</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<DOLABELLA>	<91%>

<DOLABELLA>	<94%>
	Where is the queen?
</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<DOLABELLA>	<94%>
	Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
	Which my love makes religion to obey,
	I tell you this: Cæsar through Syria
	Intends his journey; and within three days
	You with your children will be send before.
	Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
	Your pleasure and my promise.

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>

	I your servant.
	Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Cæsar.

</DOLABELLA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<DOLABELLA>	<99%>
	Cæsar, thy thoughts
	Touch their effects in this; thyself art coming
	To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
	So sought'st to hinder.

	Who was last with them?

	Here, on her breast,
	There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
	The like is on her arm.
