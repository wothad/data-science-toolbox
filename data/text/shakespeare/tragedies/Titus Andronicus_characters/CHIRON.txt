	Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all
	And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
	'Tis not the difference of a year or two
	Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
	I am as able and as fit as thou
	To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
	And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
	And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
</CHIRON>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
