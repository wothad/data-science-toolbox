	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
	Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
	To tremble under Titus' threatening look.
	Then, madam, stand resolv'd; but hope withal
	The self-same gods, that arm'd the Queen of Troy
	With opportunity of sharp revenge
	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
	May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths—
	When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen—
	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

	Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge
	And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
	And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<DEMETRIUS>	<21%>
	Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
	Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
	Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
	Go to; have your lath glu'd within your sheath
	Till you know better how to handle it.

	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?

	Not I, till I have sheath'd
	My rapier in his bosom, and withal
	Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
	That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here.

	Why mak'st thou it so strange?
	She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
	She is a woman, therefore may be won;
	She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.
	What, man! more water glideth by the mill
	Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
	Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother,
	Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.

	Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her:

	And shall she carry this unto her grave?

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>

	Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
