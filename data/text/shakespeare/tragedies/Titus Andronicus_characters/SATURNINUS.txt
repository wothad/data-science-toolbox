	Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
	To us in our election this day,
	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
	Thy name and honourable family,
	Lavinia will I make my empress,
	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><9%>
<SATURNINUS>	<10%>
	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
	Rome shall record, and, when I do forget
	The least of these unspeakable deserts,
	Romans, forget your fealty to me.
</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SATURNINUS>	<11%>
	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
	Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome:
	Princely shall be thy usage every way.
	Rest on my word, and let not discontent
	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
	Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><10%>
<SATURNINUS>	<11%>
	Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
	Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>

</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<SATURNINUS>	<12%>
	No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
	Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
	I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
	Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
	Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
	Was none in Rome to make a stale
	But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
	Agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
	That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<SATURNINUS>	<13%>
	But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
	To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
	A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;

	Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
	And will create thee Empress of Rome.
	Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
	And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
	Sith priest and holy water are so near,
	And tapers burn so bright, and every thing
	In readiness for Hymenæus stand,
	I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
	Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
	I lead espous'd my bride along with me.

	Come; if the emperor's court can feast two brides,

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><36%>
<SATURNINUS>	<36%>
	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
	He and his lady both are at the lodge,

	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<SATURNINUS>	<37%>
	And if we miss to meet him handsomely,
	Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean,
	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
	Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
	Among the nettles at the elder-tree
	Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
	Where we decreed to bury Bassianus:
	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.
	O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
	That should have murder'd Bassianus here.

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>

	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.

	Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
	An emperor of Rome thus overborne,
	Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
	Of egal justice, us'd in such contempt?
	My lords, you know, as do the mightful gods,—
	However these disturbers of our peace
	Buzz in the people's ears,—there nought hath pass'd,
	But even with law, against the wilful sons
	Of old Andronicus. And what an if
	His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
	What's this but libelling against the senate,
	And blazoning our injustice every where?
	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
	Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
	But he and his shall know that justice lives
	In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,
	He'll so awake, as she in fury shall
	Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
</SATURNINUS>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>

	Go, take him away, and hang him presently.

	Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
	Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
	I know from whence this same device proceeds:
	May this be borne? As if his traitorous sons,
	That died by law for murder of our brother,
	Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
	Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
	Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
	For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
	Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
	In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

	Myself hath often heard them say,
	When I have walked like a private man,
