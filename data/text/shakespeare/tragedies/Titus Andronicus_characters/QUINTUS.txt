	And shall, or him we will accompany.

	He that would vouch it in any place but here.

	Father, and in that name doth nature speak,—

	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<QUINTUS>	<34%>
	What! art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
	Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
	As fresh as morning's dew distill'd on flowers?
	A very fatal place it seems to me.
	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<QUINTUS>	<35%>
	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
	A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints:
	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.
	O! tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
	Was I a child, to fear I know not what.

	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good
	I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
</QUINTUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<QUINTUS>	<36%>
	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
	Till thou art here aloft, or I below.
	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
