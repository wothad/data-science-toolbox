	Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
	That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
	Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
	Before this earthy prison of their bones;
	That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
	Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<LUCIUS>	<5%>
	Away with him! and make a fire straight;
	And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
	Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<LUCIUS>	<6%>
	See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
	Our Roman rites. Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
	And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
	Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
	Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
	And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><8%>
<LUCIUS>	<9%>
	Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
	That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
<LUCIUS>	<11%>
	And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><11%>
<LUCIUS>	<12%>
	My lord, you are unjust; and, more than so,
	In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><12%>
<LUCIUS>	<12%>
	Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife
	That is another's lawful promis'd love.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><14%>
<LUCIUS>	<14%>
	But let us give him burial, as becomes;
	Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
<LUCIUS>	<15%>
	Dear father, soul and substance of us all,—
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><15%>
<LUCIUS>	<16%>
	There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
	Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><19%>
<LUCIUS>	<19%>
	We do; and vow to heaven and to his highness,
	That what we did was mildly, as we might,
	Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
	O noble father, you lament in vain:
	The tribunes hear you not, no man is by;
	And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
	My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<LUCIUS>	<43%>
	To rescue my two brothers from their death;
	For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
	My everlasting doom of banishment.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<LUCIUS>	<43%>
	Ay me! this object kills me.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<LUCIUS>	<44%>
	Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<LUCIUS>	<44%>
	O! say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<LUCIUS>	<46%>
	Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
	See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<LUCIUS>	<46%>
	Ah! my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<LUCIUS>	<47%>
	Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
	That hath thrown down so many enemies,
	Shall not be sent; my hand will serve the turn:
	My youth can better spare my blood than you;
	And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<LUCIUS>	<48%>
	By heaven, it shall not go!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<LUCIUS>	<48%>
	Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
	Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<LUCIUS>	<48%>
	Then I'll go fetch an axe.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<LUCIUS>	<50%>
	Ah! that this sight should make so deep a wound,
	And yet detested life not shrink thereat,
	That ever death should let life bear his name,
	Where life hath no more interest but to breathe.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<LUCIUS>	<52%>
	Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father;
	The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome:
	Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
	He leaves his pledges dearer than his life.
	Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
	O! would thou wert as thou tofore hast been;
	But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
	But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
	If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs,
	And make proud Saturnine and his empress
	Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.
	Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,
	To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><77%>
<LUCIUS>	<77%>
	Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
	I have received letters from great Rome,
	Which signify what hate they bear their emperor,
	And how desirous of our sight they are.
	Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
	Imperious and impatient of your wrongs;
	And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
	Let him make treble satisfaction.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 1><78%>
<LUCIUS>	<78%>
	I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
	But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LUCIUS>	<79%>
	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
	That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand:
	This is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye,
	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
	Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
	This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
	Why dost not speak? What! deaf? not a word?
	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree,
	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LUCIUS>	<79%>
	Too like the sire for ever being good.
	First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
	A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
	Get me a ladder.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
	Say on; and if it please me which thou speak'st,
	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
	Tell on thy mind: I say, thy child shall live.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LUCIUS>	<80%>
	Who should I swear by? thou believ'st no god:
	That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<LUCIUS>	<81%>
	O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<82%>
	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	Bring down the devil, for he must not die
	So sweet a death as hanging presently.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	Let him come near.

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<84%>
	Æmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
	Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
	And we will come. March away.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
	Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
	That I repair to Rome, I am content.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
	Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
	This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
	Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him,
	Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
	For testimony of her foul proceedings:
	And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
	I fear the emperor means no good to us.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<LUCIUS>	<92%>
	Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
	Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Goths, with Aaron. Trumpets sound.>
</STAGE DIR>
	The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<LUCIUS>	<93%>
	What boots it thee, to call thyself a sun?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<LUCIUS>	<95%>
	Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
	There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<LUCIUS>	<96%>
	Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
	That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
	Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
	And they it was that ravished our sister.
	For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
	Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
	Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
	And sent her enemies unto the grave:
	Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
	The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
	To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
	Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
	And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend:
	And I am the turn'd forth, be it known to you,
	That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood,
	And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
	Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
	Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
	My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
	That my report is just and full of truth.
	But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
	Citing my worthless praise: O! pardon me;
	For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<LUCIUS>	<98%>
	Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
	To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
	But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
	For nature puts me to a heavy task.
	Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near,
	To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
	O! take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses Titus.>
</STAGE DIR>
	These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
	The last true duties of thy noble son!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LUCIUS>	<98%>
	Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
	To melt in showers: thy grandsire lov'd thee well:
	Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,
	Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
	Many a matter hath he told to thee,
	Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
	In that respect, then, like a loving child,
	Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
	Because kind nature doth require it so:
	Friends should associate friends in grief and woe.
	Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
	Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<LUCIUS>	<99%>
	Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
	There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food:
	If any one relieves or pities him,
	For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
	Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<LUCIUS>	<99%>
	Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
	And give him burial in his father's grave.
	My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
	Be closed in our household's monument.
	As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
	No funeral rite, nor man in mournful weeds,
	No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
	But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey.
	Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
	And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
	See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
	By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
	Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
	That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
</LUCIUS>
