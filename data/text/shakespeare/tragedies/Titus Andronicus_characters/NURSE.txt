	Good morrow, lords. O! tell me, did you see
	Aaron the Moor?
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<NURSE>	<63%>
	O gentle Aaron! we are all undone.
	Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<NURSE>	<64%>
	O! that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
	Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
	She is deliver'd, lords, she is deliver'd.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<NURSE>	<64%>
	I mean, she's brought a-bed.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<NURSE>	<64%>
	A devil.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 2><63%>
<NURSE>	<64%>
	A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue.
	Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
	Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime.
	The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
	And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<NURSE>	<64%>
	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
<NURSE>	<66%>
	The emperor in his rage will doom her death.
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<NURSE>	<66%>
	Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
</NURSE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<NURSE>	<67%>
	Cornelia the midwife, and myself,
	And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
</NURSE>
