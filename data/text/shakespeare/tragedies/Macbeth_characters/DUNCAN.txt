	O worthiest cousin!
	The sin of my ingratitude even now
	Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
	That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
	To overtake thee; would thou hadst less deserv'd,
	That the proportion both of thanks and payment
	Might have been mine! only I have left to say,

<DUNCAN>	<12%>
	Welcome hither:
	I have begun to plant thee, and will labour

	That hast no less deserv'd, nor must be known
	No less to have done so, let me infold thee
	And hold thee to my heart.

	The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
	Not unaccompanied invest him only,
	But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
	On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
	And bind us further to you.

	True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
