	Good morrow, noble sir.

	The night has been unruly: where we lay,
	Ourchimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
	Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
	And prophesying with accents terrible
	Of dire combustion and confus'd events
	New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird
	Clamour'd the livelong night: some say the earth
	Was feverous and did shake.

	Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
	Their hands and faces were all badg'd with blood;
	So were their daggers, which unwip'd we found
	Upon their pillows: they star'd, and were distracted; no man's life
	Was to be trusted with them.

	May it please your highness sit?

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>

	Here, my good lord. What is 't that moves your highness?

	My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
	Which can interpret further: only, I say,
	Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
	Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
	And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
	Whom, you may say, if 't please you, Fleance kill'd,
	For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
	Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
	It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
	To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
	How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
	In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
	That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
	Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
	For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
	To hear the men deny 't. So that, I say,
	He has borne all things well; and I do think
	That, had he Duncan's sons under his key,—
	As, an 't please heaven, he shall not,—they should find
	What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
	But, peace! for from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd.
	His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,
	Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
	Where he bestows himself?
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
<LENNOX>	<60%>
	Sent he to Macduff?
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 6><59%>
<LENNOX>	<60%>
	And that well might
	Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
	His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
	Fly to the court of England and unfold
	His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
	May soon return to this our suffering country
	Under a hand accurs'd!
</LENNOX>

</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LENNOX>	<67%>
	No, my lord.
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LENNOX>	<67%>
	No indeed, my lord.
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LENNOX>	<67%>
	'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
	Macduff is fled to England.
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<LENNOX>	<67%>
	Ay, my good lord.
</LENNOX>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
<LENNOX>	<86%>
	For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
	Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
	And many unrough youths that even now
	Protest their first of manhood.

	Or so much as it needs
	To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
	Make we our march towards Birnam.
