	A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
	And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd: 'Give me,' quoth I:
	'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
	Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
	But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
	And, like a rat without a tail,
	I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

	I myself have all the other;
	And the very ports they blow,
	All the quarters that they know
	I' the shipman's card.
	I'll drain him dry as hay:
	Sleep shall neither night nor day
	Hang upon his pent-house lid;
	He shall live a man forbid.
	Weary se'nnights nine times nine
	Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
	Though his bark cannot be lost,
	Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
	Look what I have.

	While you perform your antick round,

	Our duties did his welcome pay.
