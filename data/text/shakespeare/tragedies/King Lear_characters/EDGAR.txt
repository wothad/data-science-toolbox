	The country gives me proof and precedent

	Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;

Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.

	That follow'd me so near,—O! our lives' sweetness,
	That we the pain of death would hourly die
	Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift
	Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance
	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
	Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
	Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
	Never,—O fault!—reveal'd myself unto him,
	Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;
	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,—
	Alack! too weak the conflict to support;
	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
	Burst smilingly.

	This would have seem'd a period
	To such as love not sorrow; but another,
	To amplify too much, would make much more,
	And top extremity.
	Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man,
	Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
	Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
	Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
	He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
	As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
	That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
	His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
	Began to crack: twice then the trumpet sounded,
	And there I left him tranc'd.

	Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
	Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
	Improper for a slave.

	He is gone, indeed.
