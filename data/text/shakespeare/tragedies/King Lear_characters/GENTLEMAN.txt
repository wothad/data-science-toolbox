<GENTLEMAN>	<27%>
	Ready, my lord.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<37%>
	As I learn'd,
	The night before there was no purpose in them
	Of this remove.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<39%>
	Made you no more offence than what you speak of?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<46%>
	One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<47%>
	Contending with the fretful elements;
	Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
	Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
	That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
	Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
	Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
	Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
	The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
	This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
	The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
	Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
	And bids what will take all.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<47%>
	None but the fool, who labours to out-jest
	His heart-struck injuries.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<48%>
	I will talk further with you.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<48%>
	Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger, that his personal return was most required and necessary.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
	Her delicate cheek; it seem'd she was a queen
	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
	Sought to be king o'er her.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<71%>
	Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove
	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
	Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
	Were like a better way; those happy smilets
	That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
	Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
	If all could so become it.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'
	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
	Cried, 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
	And clamour-moisten'd, then away she started
	To deal with grief alone.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	No.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	No, since.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	Why, good sir?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	Alack! poor gentleman.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<72%>
	'Tis so, they are afoot.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<80%>
	O! here he is; lay hand upon him. Sir,
	Your most dear daughter—
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<80%>
	You shall have any thing.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<80%>
	Good sir,—
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	You are a royal one, and we obey you.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
	Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
	Who redeems nature from the general curse
	Which twain have brought her to.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	Sir, speed you: what's your will?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	Most sure and vulgar; every one hears that,
	Which can distinguish sound.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	Near, and on speedy foot; the main descry
	Stands on the hourly thought.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<81%>
	Though that the queen on special cause is here,
	Her army is mov'd on.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 7><83%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<84%>
	Ay, madam; in the heaviness of sleep,
	We put fresh garments on him.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<86%>
	Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<86%>
	Who is conductor of his people?
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<86%>
	They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<86%>
	The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
	Fare you well, sir.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<96%>
	Help, help! O help!
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<97%>
	'Tis hot, it smokes;
	It came even from the heart of—O! she's dead.
</GENTLEMAN>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<GENTLEMAN>	<97%>
	Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
	By her is poison'd; she confesses it.
</GENTLEMAN>
