	Good my lord,
	You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
	Return those duties back as are right fit,
	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
	Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
	To love my father all.

	I yet beseech your majesty—
	If for I want that glib and oily art
	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
	I'll do 't before I speak—that you make known
	It is no vicious blot nor other foulness,
	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
	That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour,
	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
	That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
	Hath lost me in your liking.

	Peace be with Burgundy!

	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;

	Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father:
	To your professed bosoms I commit him:
	But yet, alas! stood I within his grace,
	I would prefer him to a better place.
	So farewell to you both.

	Alack! 'tis he: why, he was met even now
	As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
	Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
	With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
	Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
	In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
	Search every acre in the high-grown field,
	And bring him to our eye.

	'Tis known before; our preparation stands

	Had you not been their father, these white flakes
	Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face

	To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
	In the most terrible and nimble stroke
	Of quick cross lightning? to watch—poor perdu!—
	With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
	Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
	Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father,
	To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,
	In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
	'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
	Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
