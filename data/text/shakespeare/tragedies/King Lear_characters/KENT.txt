	Royal Lear,

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>

	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade

	When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;
	And, in thy best consideration, check

	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
	Reverbs no hollowness.

	My lord, when at their home
	I did commend your highness' letters to them,
	Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
	My duty kneeling, there came a reeking post,
	Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
	From Goneril his mistress salutations;
	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
	Which presently they read: on whose contents
	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
	Commanded me to follow, and attend
	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
	And meeting here the other messenger,
	Whose welcome, I perceiv'd, had poison'd mine,—
	Being the very fellow which of late
	Display'd so saucily against your highness,—
	Having more man than wit about me,—drew:
	He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
	Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
	The shame which here it suffers.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>

</KENT>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>
<KENT>	<47%>
	Sir, I do know you;
	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
	Who have—as who have not, that their great stars
	Thron'd and set high—servants, who seem no less,
	Which are to France the spies and speculations
	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
	In some of our best ports, and are at point
	To show their open banner. Now to you:
	If on my credit you dare build so far
	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
	Some that will thank you, making just report
	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
	The king hath cause to plain.
	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
	And from some knowledge and assurance offer
	This office to you.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<KENT>	<48%>
	No, do not.
	For confirmation that I am much more
	Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
	What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,—
	As doubt not but you shall,—show her this ring,
	And she will tell you who your fellow is
	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
	I will go seek the king.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<KENT>	<48%>

	Alas! sir, are you here? things that love night
	Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies

	And make them keep their caves. Since I was man
	Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,

	His mind so venomously that burning shame
	Detains him from Cordelia.

	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 3><71%>
<KENT>	<72%>
	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
	And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
	Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
	Along with me.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 7><83%>
<KENT>	<83%>
	To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
	All my reports go with the modest truth,
	Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 7><83%>
<KENT>	<84%>
	Pardon me, dear madam;
	Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
	My boon I make it that you know me not
	Till time and I think meet.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 7><84%>
<KENT>	<84%>
	Kind and dear princess!
</KENT>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<KENT>	<86%>
	In your own kingdom, sir.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<KENT>	<86%>
	Most certain, sir.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<KENT>	<86%>
	As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>

	Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of the kingdom approach apace.

<SPEECH 114><ACT 4><SCENE 7><86%>
<KENT>	<86%>
	My point and period will be throughly wrought,
	Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

	I am come
	To bid my king and master aye good-night;
	Is he not here?
</KENT>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<KENT>	<97%>
	Alack! why thus?
</KENT>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>

	Is this the promis'd end?

</STAGE DIR> O, my good master!

	If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,

	The same,
	Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
</KENT>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<KENT>	<99%>
	No, my good lord; I am the very man—
</KENT>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<KENT>	<99%>
	That, from your first of difference and decay,
	Have follow'd your sad steps.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 123><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<KENT>	<99%>
	Nor no man else; all's cheerless, dark, and deadly:
	Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
	And desperately are dead.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 124><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<KENT>	<99%>
	Break, heart; I prithee, break.

	Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hates him
	That would upon the rack of this tough world
	Stretch him out longer.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 126><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<KENT>	<100%>
	The wonder is he hath endur'd so long:
	He but usurp'd his life.
</KENT>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<KENT>	<100%>
	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
	My master calls me, I must not say no.
