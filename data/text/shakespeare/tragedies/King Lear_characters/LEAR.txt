	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
	In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
	To shake all cares and business from our age,
	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
	Unburden'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
	We have this hour a constant will to publish
	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,—
	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
	Interest of territory, cares of state,—
	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
	That we our largest bounty may extend
	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
	Our eldest-born, speak first.

	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,

	To thee and thine, hereditary ever,

	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

	Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,

	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
	I do invest you jointly with my power,

	That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
	With reservation of a hundred knights,
	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode

</STAGE DIR> Never, Regan.
	She hath abated me of half my train;

	No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
	Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give

	To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
	To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
	And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
	Against my coming in: thou better know'st

	Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took

	Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
	Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
	A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
	In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
	Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
	I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
	Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.

	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts

<SPEECH 174><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<LEAR>	<86%>
	Do not abuse me.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 175><ACT 4><SCENE 7><85%>
<LEAR>	<86%>
	You must bear with me.
	Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 176><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<LEAR>	<90%>
	No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison;
	We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
	When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
	And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
	And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
	At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
	Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
	Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
	And take upon's the mystery of things,
	As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
	In a wall'd prison, packs and sets of great ones
	That ebb and flow by the moon.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 177><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<LEAR>	<90%>
	Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
	The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
	He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
	And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
	The goujeres shall devour them, flesh and fell,
	Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
	Come.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 178><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	Howl, howl, howl, howl! O! you are men of stones:
	Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so
	That heaven's vaults should crack. She's gone for ever.
	I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
	She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
	If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
	Why, then she lives.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 179><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
	It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
	That ever I have felt.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 180><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	Prithee, away.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 181><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
	I might have sav'd her; now, she's gone for ever!
	Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
	What is 't thou sayst? Her voice was ever soft,
	Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.
	I kill'd the slave that was a hanging thee.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 182><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	Did I not, fellow?
	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
	I would have made them skip: I am old now,
	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 183><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<98%>
	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 184><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<99%>
	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
	He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 185><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<99%>
	I'll see that straight.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 186><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<99%>
	You are welcome hither.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 187><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<LEAR>	<99%>
	Ay, so I think.
</LEAR>

<SPEECH 188><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<LEAR>	<99%>
	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
	Never, never, never, never, never!
	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
	Look there, look there!
</LEAR>
