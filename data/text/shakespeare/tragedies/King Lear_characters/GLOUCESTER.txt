	But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came somewhat saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.

	This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, <EDGAR.—HUM! CONSPIRACY! 'SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM, YOU...>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 2><12%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<12%>
	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked between son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing: do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange!

<GLOUCESTER>	<35%>
	Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
	His fault is much, and the good king his master

<GLOUCESTER>	<51%>
	Alack, alack! Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 3><50%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<51%>
	Go to; say you nothing. There is division between the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet. These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to the king. I will seek him and privily relieve him; go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king, my old master, must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.

	Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;

</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>

	If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that dern time,

	I know that voice.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 4><SCENE 6><77%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<78%>
	The trick of that voice I do well remember:
	Is 't not the king?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	O! let me kiss that hand!
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
	Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	Were all the letters suns, I could not see.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	What! with the case of eyes?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	I see it feelingly.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 6><78%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<79%>
	Ay, sir.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 4><SCENE 6><79%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<80%>
	Alack! alack the day!
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<81%>
	You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
	Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
	To die before you please!
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 4><SCENE 6><80%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<81%>
	Now, good sir, what are you?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<81%>
	Hearty thanks:
	The bounty and the benison of heaven
	To boot, and boot!

</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 4><SCENE 6><81%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<82%>
	Now let thy friendly hand
	Put strength enough to 't.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<82%>
	What! is he dead?
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 4><SCENE 6><82%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<83%>
	The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
	That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
	Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
	So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
	And woes by wrong imaginations lose
	The knowledge of themselves.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<89%>
	Grace go with you, sir!
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>

</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<89%>
	No further, sir; a man may rot even here.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<89%>
	And that's true too.
</GLOUCESTER>
