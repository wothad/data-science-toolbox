<ALBANY>	<5%>
	Dear sir, forbear.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 4><22%>
<ALBANY>	<23%>
	Pray, sir, be patient.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
<ALBANY>	<23%>
	My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
	Of what hath mov'd you.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
<ALBANY>	<24%>
	Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><23%>
<ALBANY>	<24%>
	What's the matter, sir?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
<ALBANY>	<25%>
	I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
	To the great love I bear you.—
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 4><24%>
<ALBANY>	<25%>
	Well, you may fear too far.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
<ALBANY>	<26%>
	How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:
	Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><25%>
<ALBANY>	<26%>
	Well, well; the event.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<ALBANY>	<69%>
	O Goneril!
	You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
	Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
	That nature, which contemns its origin,
	Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
	She that herself will sliver and disbranch
	From her material sap, perforce must wither
	And come to deadly use.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<ALBANY>	<69%>
	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
	Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
	Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
	A father, and a gracious aged man,
	Whose reverence the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
	It will come,
	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
	Like monsters of the deep.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	See thyself, devil!
	Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
	So horrid as in woman.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
	Be-monster not thy feature. Were 't my fitness
	To let these hands obey my blood,
	They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
	Thy flesh and bones; howe'er thou art a fiend,
	A woman's shape doth shield thee.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	What news?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	Gloucester's eyes!
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	This shows you are above,
	You justicers, that these our nether crimes
	So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
	Lost he his other eye?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><69%>
<ALBANY>	<70%>
	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
<ALBANY>	<71%>
	He is not here.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
<ALBANY>	<71%>
	Knows he the wickedness?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 2><70%>
<ALBANY>	<71%>
	Gloucester, I live
	To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
	And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
	Tell me what more thou knowest.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 1><86%>
<ALBANY>	<87%>
	Our very loving sister, well be-met.
	Sir, this I heard, the king is come to his daughter,
	With others; whom the rigour of our state
	Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest
	I never yet was valiant: for this business,
	It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
	Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
	Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ALBANY>	<87%>
	Let's then determine
	With the ancient of war on our proceeding.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ALBANY>	<88%>
	I'll overtake you. Speak.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ALBANY>	<88%>
	Stay till I have read the letter.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<ALBANY>	<88%>
	Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR>

</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<ALBANY>	<88%>
	We will greet the time.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<ALBANY>	<91%>
	Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
	And fortune led you well; you have the captives
	Who were the opposites of this day's strife;
	We do require them of you, so to use them
	As we shall find their merits and our safety
	May equally determine.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<ALBANY>	<91%>
	Sir, by your patience,
	I hold you but a subject of this war,
	Not as a brother.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
	The let-alone lies not in your good will.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
	Half-blooded fellow, yes.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
	Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
	On capital treason; and, in thy arrest,
	This gilded serpent. <STAGE DIR>
<Pointing to Goneril.>
</STAGE DIR> For your claim, fair sister,
	I bar it in the interest of my wife;
	'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
	And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
	If you will marry, make your love to me,
	My lady is bespoke.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<ALBANY>	<92%>
	Thou art arm'd, Gloucester; let the trumpet sound:
	If none appear to prove upon thy person
	Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
	There is my pledge; <STAGE DIR>
<Throws down a glove.>
</STAGE DIR> I'll prove it on thy heart,
	Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
	Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
	A herald, ho!
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
	Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
	All levied in my name, have in my name
	Took their discharge.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
	She is not well; convey her to my tent.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Regan, led.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Come hither, herald,

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter a Herald.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Let the trumpet sound,—
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
	Ask him his purposes, why he appears
	Upon this call o' the trumpet.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<ALBANY>	<93%>
	Which is that adversary?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<ALBANY>	<94%>
	Save him, save him!
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<ALBANY>	<94%>
	Shut your mouth, dame,
	Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;
	Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
	No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
	Most monstrous!
	Know'st thou this paper?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
	Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
	Methought thy very gait did prophesy
	A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
	Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
	Did hate thee or thy father.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
<ALBANY>	<95%>
	Where have you hid yourself?
	How have you known the miseries of your father?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><95%>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
	If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
	For I am almost ready to dissolve,
	Hearing of this.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
	But who was this?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<ALBANY>	<96%>
	Speak, man.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Who dead? speak, man.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead:
	This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
	Touches us not with pity.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Gentleman.>
</STAGE DIR>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter Kent.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O! is this he?
	The time will not allow the compliment
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Great thing of us forgot!
	Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
	Seest thou this object, Kent?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Even so. Cover their faces.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Run, run! O run!
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<ALBANY>	<97%>
	Haste thee, for thy life.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<ALBANY>	<98%>
	The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
<STAGE DIR>
<Edmund is borne off.>
</STAGE DIR>

</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<ALBANY>	<98%>
	Fall and cease?
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<ALBANY>	<99%>
	He knows not what he says, and vain it is
	That we present us to him.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 3><98%>
<ALBANY>	<99%>
	That's but a trifle here.
	You lords and noble friends, know our intent;
	What comfort to this great decay may come
	Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
	During the life of this old majesty,
	To him our absolute power:—<STAGE DIR>
<To Edgar and Kent.>
</STAGE DIR> You, to your rights;
	With boot and such addition as your honours
	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
	The wages of their virtue, and all foes
	The cup of their deservings. O! see, see!
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<ALBANY>	<100%>
	Bear them from hence. Our present business
	Is general woe. <STAGE DIR>
<To Kent and Edgar.>
</STAGE DIR> Friends of my soul, you twain
	Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
</ALBANY>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 3><99%>
<ALBANY>	<100%>
	The weight of this sad time we must obey;
	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,
	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
</ALBANY>
