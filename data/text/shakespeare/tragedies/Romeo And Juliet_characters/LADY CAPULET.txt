	A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
	This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile.
	We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again;
	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<12%>
	She's not fourteen.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<13%>
	A fortnight and odd days.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><13%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
	How stands your disposition to be married?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
	Are made already mothers: by my count,
	I was your mother much upon these years
	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief,
	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<14%>
	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<15%>
	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
	Examine every married lineament,
	And see how one another lends content;
	And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
	For fair without the fair within to hide:
	That book in many eyes doth share the glory,
	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story:
	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
	By having him making yourself no less.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<15%>
	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<15%>
	We follow thee. Juliet, the county stays.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<51%>
	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
	O prince! O cousin! husband! O! the blood is spill'd
	Of my dear kinsman. Prince, as thou art true,
	For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
	O cousin, cousin!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<52%>
	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
	Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 4><63%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<63%>
	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
	To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<66%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Within.>
</STAGE DIR> Ho, daughter! are you up?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<66%>
	Why, how now, Juliet!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<66%>
	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
	What! wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
	And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<66%>
	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
	Which you weep for.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<66%>
	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 5><66%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<67%>
	That same villain, Romeo.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<67%>
	That is because the traitor murderer lives.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<67%>
	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
	Where that same banish'd runsgate doth live;
	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<67%>
	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<67%>
	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
	That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 5><67%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<68%>
	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
	The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's church,
	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<68%>
	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
	And see how he will take it at your hands.

</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 5><68%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<68%>
	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
	I would the fool were married to her grave!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 5><69%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<69%>
	Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<70%>
	You are too hot.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 5><70%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<70%>
	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<77%>
	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<77%>
	We shall be short in our provision:
	'Tis now near night.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<78%>
	What! are you busy, ho? need you my help?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<78%>
	Good-night:
	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<80%>
	Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<80%>
	Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
	But I will watch you from such watching now.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<81%>
	What noise is here?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<81%>
	What is the matter?
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<81%>
	O me, O me! my child, my only life,
	Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
	Help, help! Call help.

</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 5><81%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<82%>
	Alack the day! she's dead, she's dead! she's dead!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<82%>
	O woeful time!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 5><82%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<82%>
	Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful-day!
	Most miserable hour, that e'er time saw
	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<96%>
	The people in the street cry Romeo,
	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run
	With open outcry toward our monument.
</LADY CAPULET>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<LADY CAPULET>	<97%>
	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

</LADY CAPULET>
