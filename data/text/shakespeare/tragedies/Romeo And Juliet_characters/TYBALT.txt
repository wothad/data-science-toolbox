	What! art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?

	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What! dares the slave
	Come hither, cover'd with an antick face,
	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
	To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 5><21%>
<TYBALT>	<21%>
	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
	A villain that is hither come in spite,

	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
