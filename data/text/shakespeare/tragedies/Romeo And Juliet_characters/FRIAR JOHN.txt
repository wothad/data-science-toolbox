	Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

</FRIAR JOHN>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<88%>
	Going to find a bare-foot brother out,
	One of our order, to associate me,
	Here in this city visiting the sick,
	And finding him, the searchers of the town,
	Suspecting that we both were in a house
	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
</FRIAR JOHN>

	I could not send it, here it is again,
	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
	So fearful were they of infection.
</FRIAR JOHN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<FRIAR JOHN>	<89%>
	Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
</FRIAR JOHN>
