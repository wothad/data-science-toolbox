	Nay, but his taunts.

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SICINIUS>	<8%>
	Such a nature,
	Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
	Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
	His insolence can brook to be commanded
	Under Cominius.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 1><7%>
<SICINIUS>	<8%>
	Besides, if things go well,

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>

	He cannot temperately transport his honours

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
<SICINIUS>	<30%>
	Doubt not, the commoners, for whom we stand,

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<SICINIUS>	<30%>
	'Tis right.

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<SICINIUS>	<30%>

	In execution.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<SICINIUS>	<31%>
	It shall be to him then, as our good wills,

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<SICINIUS>	<31%>
	This, as you say, suggested
	At some time when his soaring insolence
	Shall teach the people—which time shall not want,
	If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
<SICINIUS>	<41%>
	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><40%>
<SICINIUS>	<41%>
	Why, so he did, I am sure.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
<SICINIUS>	<41%>
	Why, either were you ignorant to see 't,
	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
	To yield your voices?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
<SICINIUS>	<42%>
	Thus to have said,
	As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
	And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
	Either his gracious promise, which you might,
	As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
	Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
	Which easily endures not article
	Tying him to aught; so, putting him to rage,
	You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler,
	And pass'd him unelected.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><41%>
<SICINIUS>	<42%>
	Have you
	Ere now denied the asker? and now again

	Your su'd-for tongues?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
<SICINIUS>	<43%>
	Let them assemble;
	And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
	Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride,
	And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
	With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
	How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
	Thinking upon his services, took from you
	The apprehension of his present portance,
	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
	After the inveterate hate he bears you.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
<SICINIUS>	<43%>
	Say, you chose him
	More after our commandment than as guided
	By your own true affections; and that, your minds,
	Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
	Than what you should, made you against the grain
	To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><42%>
<SICINIUS>	<43%>
	One thus descended,
	That hath, beside, well in his person wrought
	To be set high in place, we did commend
	To your remembrances: but you have found,
	Scaling his present bearing with his past,
	That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
	Your sudden approbation.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><43%>
<SICINIUS>	<44%>
	To the Capitol, come:
	We will be there before the stream o' the people;

<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<SICINIUS>	<46%>
	You show too much of that
	For which the people stir; if you will pass
	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit;

	Nor yoke with him for tribune.

	Go, call the people; <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Ædile>
</STAGE DIR> in whose name, myself

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<SICINIUS>	<49%>
	Help, ye citizens!

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<SICINIUS>	<49%>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<SICINIUS>	<50%>
	Hear me, people; peace!
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>

	You are at point to lose your liberties:

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<SICINIUS>	<50%>
	What is the city but the people?

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>

	This deserves death.

<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<SICINIUS>	<50%>
	Therefore lay hold of him;
	Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
	Into destruction cast him.

<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<SICINIUS>	<52%>
	Where is this viper

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<SICINIUS>	<52%>
	He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
	With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,

	Which he so sets at nought.

<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<SICINIUS>	<52%>
	Speak briefly then;
	For we are peremptory to dispatch
	This viperous traitor. To eject him hence
	Were but one danger, and to keep him here
	Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
	He dies to-night.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 1><52%>
<SICINIUS>	<53%>
	He's a disease that must be cut away.

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
<SICINIUS>	<53%>
	What do ye talk?
	Have we not had a taste of his obedience?

<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
<SICINIUS>	<54%>
	Noble Menenius,

<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
<SICINIUS>	<54%>
	Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:

	In our first way.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Have you a catalogue

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Have you collected them by tribes?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Assemble presently the people hither;
	And when they hear me say, 'It shall be so,
	I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
	For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
	If I say, fine, cry 'fine,'—if death, cry 'death,'
	Insisting on the old prerogative
	And power i' the truth o' the cause.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Make them be strong and ready for this hint,

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Well, here he comes.

<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<SICINIUS>	<59%>
	Draw near, ye people.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<SICINIUS>	<60%>
	I do demand,
	If you submit you to the people's voices,
	Allow their officers, and are content
	To suffer lawful censure for such faults
	As shall be prov'd upon you?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<SICINIUS>	<60%>
	Answer to us.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<SICINIUS>	<60%>
	We charge you, that you have contriv'd to take
	From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
	Yourself into a power tyrannical;
	For which you are a traitor to the people.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 72><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<SICINIUS>	<60%>
	Mark you this, people!
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<SICINIUS>	<61%>
	Peace!
	We need not put new matter to his charge:
	What you have seen him do, and heard him speak,
	Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
	Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
	Those whose great power must try him; even this,
	So criminal and in such capital kind,
	Deserves the extremest death.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
<SICINIUS>	<61%>
	For that he has,—
	As much as in him lies,—from time to time
	Envied against the people, seeking means
	To pluck away their power, as now at last
	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
	That do distribute it; in the name o' the people,
	And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
	Even from this instant, banish him our city,
	In peril of precipitation
	From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
	To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
	I say, it shall be so.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
<SICINIUS>	<61%>
	He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
<SICINIUS>	<62%>
	We know your drift: speak what?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 3><SCENE 3><62%>
<SICINIUS>	<62%>
	Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
	As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
	Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
	Attend us through the city.
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<SICINIUS>	<64%>
	Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 4><SCENE 2><64%>
<SICINIUS>	<64%>
	Bid them home;

	What then?
</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
<SICINIUS>	<65%>
	I would he had continu'd to his country

<SPEECH 86><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>

	Why stay we to be baited

</SICINIUS>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
<SICINIUS>	<75%>
	We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
	His remedies are tame i' the present peace

	Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
	Though they themselves did suffer by 't, behold
	Dissentious numbers pestering streets, than see

<SICINIUS>	<76%>
	We should by this, to all our lamentation,
