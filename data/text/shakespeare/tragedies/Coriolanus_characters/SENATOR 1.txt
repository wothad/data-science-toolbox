	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
	The Volsces are in arms.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<SENATOR 1>	<7%>
	Then, worthy Marcius,
	Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<SENATOR 1>	<7%>
	Your company to the Capitol; where I know
	Our greatest friends attend us.

<To the Citizens.>
</STAGE DIR> Hence! to your homes! be gone.

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<SENATOR 1>	<8%>
	So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
	That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels,
	And know how we proceed.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 2><8%>
<SENATOR 1>	<9%>
	Our army's in the field:
	We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
	To answer us.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 2><9%>
<SENATOR 1>	<9%>
	Farewell.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 4><13%>
<SENATOR 1>	<13%>
	No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
	That's lesser than a little. Hark, our drums
<STAGE DIR>
<Drums afar off.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Are bringing forth our youth: we'll break our walls,
	Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
	Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
	They'll open of themselves. Hark you, far off!
<STAGE DIR>
<Alarum afar off.>
</STAGE DIR>
	There is Aufidius: list, what work he makes
	Amongst your cloven army.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<SENATOR 1>	<33%>
	Speak, good Cominius:
	Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
	Rather our state's defective for requital,
	Than we to stretch it out. <STAGE DIR>
<To the Tribunes.>
</STAGE DIR> Masters o' the people,
	We do request your kindest ears, and, after,
	Your loving motion toward the common body,
	To yield what passes here.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<SENATOR 1>	<34%>
	Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear

	He cannot but with measure fit the honours
	Which we devise him.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<SENATOR 1>	<35%>
	Call Coriolanus.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<SENATOR 1>	<45%>
	Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<SENATOR 1>	<46%>
	Not in this heat, sir, now.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<SENATOR 1>	<46%>
	No more words, we beseech you.

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>

<SENATOR 1>	<51%>
	The gods forbid!
	I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
	Leave us to cure this cause.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><53%>
<SENATOR 1>	<54%>
	Noble tribunes,
	It is the humane way: the other course
	Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
	Unknown to the beginning.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><54%>
<SENATOR 1>	<54%>
	Pray you, let's to him.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<SENATOR 1>	<55%>
	There's no remedy;
	Unless, by not so doing, our good city
	Cleave in the midst, and perish.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<SENATOR 1>	<59%>
	Amen, amen.
</SENATOR 1>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<SENATOR 1>	<95%>
	Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
	Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
	And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
	Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius;
	Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
	Cry, 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
</SENATOR 1>
