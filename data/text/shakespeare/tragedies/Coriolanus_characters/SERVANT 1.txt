<SERVANT 1>	<68%>
	Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 5><68%>
<SERVANT 1>	<69%>
	What would you have, friend? Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 5><69%>
<SERVANT 1>	<69%>
	A strange one as ever I looked on:
	I cannot get him out o' the house: prithee, call my master to him.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Advancing.>
</STAGE DIR> Here's a strange alteration!
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	What an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	He had so; looking as it were,— would I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	Nay, it's no matter for that.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the greater soldier.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	Ay, and for an assault too.

</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	What, what, what? let's partake.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<73%>
	Wherefore? wherefore?
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>
<SERVANT 1>	<74%>
	Why do you say 'thwack our general?'
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<SERVANT 1>	<74%>
	He was too hard for him,—directly to say the truth on 't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<SERVANT 1>	<74%>
	But, more of thy news.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<SERVANT 1>	<74%>
	Directitude! what's that?
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<SERVANT 1>	<74%>
	But when goes this forward?
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<SERVANT 1>	<75%>
	Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
</SERVANT 1>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 5><75%>
<SERVANT 1>	<75%>
	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
</SERVANT 1>
