	And grieve to hear 't.
	What faults he made before the last, I think
	Might have found easy fines; but there to end
	Where he was to begin, and give away
	The benefit of our levies, answering us
	With our own charge, making a treaty where
	There was a yielding, this admits no excuse.
</LORD 1>

	Peace, both, and hear me speak.

<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<LORD 1>	<100%>
	Bear from hence his body;
	And mourn you for him! Let him be regarded
	As the most noble corse that ever herald
	Did follow to his urn.
</LORD 1>
