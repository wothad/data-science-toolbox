<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 5><69%>
<SERVANT 3>	<69%>
	A marvellous poor one.

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 5><69%>
<SERVANT 3>	<69%>
	Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

	What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a strange guest he has here.

	I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as lief be a condemned man.

	Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Marcius.

<SERVANT 3>	<74%>
	I do not say, 'thwack our general;' but he was always good enough for him.

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 5><74%>
<SERVANT 3>	<74%>
	Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no question asked him by any of the senators, but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him; sanctifies himself with 's hand, and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is out i' the middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, and sowle the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he will mow down all before him, and leave his passage polled.

	Do 't! he will do 't for—look you, sir—he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir—as it were—durst not—look you, sir—show themselves—as we term it—his friends, whilst he's in directitude.

	To-morrow; to-day; presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.

	Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
