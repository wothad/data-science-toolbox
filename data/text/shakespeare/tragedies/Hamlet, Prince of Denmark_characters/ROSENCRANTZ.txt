	Both your majesties

	Put your dread pleasures more into command
	Than to entreaty.

	My most dear lord!
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<31%>
	As the indifferent children of the earth.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<31%>
	Neither, my lord.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<31%>
	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	Then is the world one.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	We think not so, my lord.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	Why, then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	We'll wait upon you.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<32%>
	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<33%>
	To what end, my lord?
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<33%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Guildenstern.>
</STAGE DIR> What say you?
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<33%>
	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<33%>
	To think, my lord; if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<34%>
	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<34%>
	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<34%>
	No, indeed they are not.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<34%>
	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages,—so they call them,—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<34%>
	Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides: and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<35%>
	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>

	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.

	Good my lord!

	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
	But from what cause he will by no means speak.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<41%>
	Most like a gentleman.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>

	Niggard of question, but of our demands
	Most free in his reply.

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<41%>
	Madam, it so fell out that certain players
	We o'er-raught on the way; of these we told him,
	And there did seem in him a kind of joy
	To hear of it: they are about the court,
	And, as I think, they have already order
	This night to play before him.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<41%>
	We shall, my lord.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<47%>
	We will, my lord.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<48%>
	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<54%>
	Then, thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amasement and admiration.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<54%>
	She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<54%>
	My lord, you once did love me.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<54%>
	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<54%>
	How can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<56%>
	The single and peculiar life is bound
	With all the strength and armour of the mind
	To keep itself from noyance; but much more
	That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
	The lives of many. The cease of majesty
	Dies not alone, but, like a gulf doth draw
	What's near it with it; it is a massy wheel,
	Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
	To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
	Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
	Each small annexment, petty consequence,
	Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
	Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<57%>
	We will haste us.

	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<66%>
	Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
	And bear it to the chapel.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 2><65%>

	Believe what?

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>

	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<66%>
	I understand you not, my lord.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<66%>
	My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<67%>
	Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
	We cannot get from him.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<67%>
	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 3><66%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<67%>
	Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

</ROSENCRANTZ>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><69%>
<ROSENCRANTZ>	<69%>
	Will 't please you go, my lord?
