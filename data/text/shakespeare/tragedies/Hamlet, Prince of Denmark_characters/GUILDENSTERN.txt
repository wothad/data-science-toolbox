	But we both obey,
	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
	To lay our service freely at your feet,
	To be commanded.

	Heavens make our presence, and our practices
	Pleasant and helpful to him!

	Mine honoured lord!
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<31%>
	Happy in that we are not over happy; On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<31%>
	Faith, her privates we.
</GUILDENSTERN>

	Prison, my lord!

	Which dreams, indeed, are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<32%>
	We'll wait upon you.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 2><32%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<32%>
	What should we say, my lord?
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<33%>
	My lord, we were sent for.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<34%>
	O! there has been much throwing about of brains.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<35%>
	There are the players.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<35%>
	In what, my dear lord?
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<41%>
	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
	When we would bring him on to some confession
	Of his true state.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<41%>
	But with much forcing of his disposition.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<47%>
	We will, my lord.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<53%>
	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<53%>
	The king, sir,—
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	No, my lord, rather with choler.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<54%>
	What, my lord?
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<55%>
	O! my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<55%>
	My lord, I cannot.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<55%>
	Believe me, I cannot.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<55%>
	I know no touch of it, my lord.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<55%>
	But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<56%>
	We will ourselves provide.
	Most holy and religious fear it is
	To keep those many many bodies safe
	That live and feed upon your majesty.
</GUILDENSTERN>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<GUILDENSTERN>	<57%>
	We will haste us.
