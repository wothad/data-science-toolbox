<SPEECH 1><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	Myself have letters of the self-same tenour.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
	Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
	Have put to death an hundred senators.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	Cicero is dead,
	And by that order of proscription.
	Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><78%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	That, methinks, is strange.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
<MESSALA>	<79%>
	No, my lord.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
<MESSALA>	<80%>
	Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
	For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 4><SCENE 3><79%>
<MESSALA>	<80%>
	Even so great men great losses should endure.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
<MESSALA>	<82%>
	Good-night, Lord Brutus.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<MESSALA>	<88%>
	What says my general?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<MESSALA>	<88%>
	Believe not so.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<MESSALA>	<92%>
	It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
	Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
	As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<MESSALA>	<93%>
	Where did you leave him?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<MESSALA>	<93%>
	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<MESSALA>	<93%>
	Is not that he?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<MESSALA>	<93%>
	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
	O hateful error, melancholy's child!
	Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
	The things that are not? O error! soon conceiv'd,
	Thou never com'st unto a happy birth,
	But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<MESSALA>	<93%>
	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
	The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
	Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
	For piercing steel and darts envenomed
	Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
	As tidings of this sight.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<MESSALA>	<94%>
	Lo, yonder: and Titinius mourning it.
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<MESSALA>	<99%>
	My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<MESSALA>	<99%>
	How died my master, Strato?
</MESSALA>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<MESSALA>	<99%>
	Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
	That did the latest service to my master.
</MESSALA>
