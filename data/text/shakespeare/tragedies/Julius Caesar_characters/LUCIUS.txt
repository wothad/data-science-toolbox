<LUCIUS>	<22%>
	Call'd you, my lord?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<LUCIUS>	<23%>
	I will, my lord.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<LUCIUS>	<24%>
	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
	Searching the window for a flint, I found
	This paper, thus seal'd up; and I am sure
	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LUCIUS>	<24%>
	I know not, sir.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LUCIUS>	<24%>
	I will, sir.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<LUCIUS>	<25%>
	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<LUCIUS>	<25%>
	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
	Who doth desire to see you.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<LUCIUS>	<25%>
	No, sir, there are more with him.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<LUCIUS>	<25%>
	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
	That by no means I may discover them
	By any mark of favour.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><33%>
<LUCIUS>	<34%>
	Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
<LUCIUS>	<41%>
	To know my errand, madam.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
	Madam, what shall I do?
	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
	And so return to you, and nothing else?
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
	I hear none, madam.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><40%>
<LUCIUS>	<42%>
	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
<LUCIUS>	<82%>
	Here in the tent.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 3><81%>
<LUCIUS>	<82%>
	Varro! and Claudius!

</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<82%>
	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	Ay, my lord, an 't please you.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	It is my duty, sir.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 3><82%>
<LUCIUS>	<83%>
	I have slept, my lord, already.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<84%>
	The strings, my lord, are false.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<84%>
	My lord!
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<84%>
	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
</LUCIUS>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 3><83%>
<LUCIUS>	<84%>
	Nothing, my lord.
</LUCIUS>
