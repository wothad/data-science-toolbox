	That I have, lady: if it will please Cæsar
	To be so good to Cæsar as to hear me,

	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
	The throng that follows Cæsar at the heels,
	Of senators, of prætors, common suitors,
	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
	I'll get me to a place more void, and there
	Speak to great Cæsar as he comes along.

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<SOOTHSAYER>	<44%>
	Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.
