	They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
	Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;
	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
	Cæsar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
	Say I fear'd Cæsar, honour'd him, and lov'd him.
	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
	May safely come to him, and be resolv'd
	How Cæsar hath deserv'd to lie in death,
	Mark Antony shall not love Cæsar dead
	So well as Brutus living; but will follow
	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
