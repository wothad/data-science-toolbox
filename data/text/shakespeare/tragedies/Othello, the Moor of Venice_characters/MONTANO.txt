	What from the cape can you discern at sea?

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<MONTANO>	<21%>
	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
	A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements;
	If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
	What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
	Can hold the mortise? what shall we hear of this?
</MONTANO>

	If that the Turkish fleet
	Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
	It is impossible they bear it out.

</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<MONTANO>	<22%>
	How! is this true?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><20%>
<MONTANO>	<22%>
	I am glad on 't; 'tis a worthy governor.

<MONTANO>	<22%>
	Pray heaven he be;
	For I have serv'd him, and the man commands
	Like a full soldier. Let's to the sea-side, ho!
	As well to see the vessel that's come in
	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
	An indistinct regard.

	Is he well shipp'd?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><21%>
<MONTANO>	<23%>
	But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv'd?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>
<MONTANO>	<23%>
	What is she?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
<MONTANO>	<33%>
	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<MONTANO>	<33%>
	I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<MONTANO>	<34%>
	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<MONTANO>	<34%>
	But is he often thus?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<MONTANO>	<35%>
	It were well
	The general were put in mind of it.
	Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
	Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
	And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?

</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<MONTANO>	<35%>
	And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
	Should hazard such a place as his own second
	With one of an ingraft infirmity;
	It were an honest action to say
	So to the Moor.
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<MONTANO>	<35%>
	What's the matter, lieutenant?
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>

<STAGE DIR>
<Staying him.>
</STAGE DIR> Nay, good lieutenant;
	I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

	'Zounds! I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<MONTANO>	<37%>
	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger;
	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,
	While I spare speech, which something now offends me,
	Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
	By me that's said or done amiss this night,
	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
	And to defend ourselves it be a sin
	When violence assails us.

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>

	If partially affin'd, or leagu'd in office,

<MONTANO>	<94%>
	What is the matter? How now, general!
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<MONTANO>	<94%>
	O monstrous act!
</MONTANO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<MONTANO>	<96%>
	'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
	Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.
	Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
	But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
	For 'tis a damned slave.
</MONTANO>
