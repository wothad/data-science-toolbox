<CLOWN>	<42%>
	Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus?
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	O! thereby hangs a tail.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	Marry, sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	If you have any music that may not be heard, to 't again; but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	Then put up your pipes in your bag, for
	I'll away. Go; vanish into air; away!
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<CLOWN>	<43%>
	She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither,
	I shall seem to notify unto her.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	I dare not say he lies any where.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	He is a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer.
</CLOWN>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<CLOWN>	<59%>
	To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
</CLOWN>
