	Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.
	It is a business of some heat; the galleys
	Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
	This very night at one another's heels,
	And many of the consuls, rais'd and met,
	Are at the duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for;
	When, being not at your lodging to be found,
	The senate hath sent about three several quests
	To search you out.

	Most fortunately: he hath achiev'd a maid

	He has had most favourable and happy speed:

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>

	'Tis truly so.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 3><29%>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<31%>
	Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	She's a most exquisite lady.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	Indeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	She is indeed perfection.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 2><SCENE 3><30%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	Where are they?
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
<CASSIO>	<32%>
	I'll do 't; but it dislikes me.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
<CASSIO>	<33%>
	'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
</CASSIO>

	'Fore God, an excellent song.

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 3><31%>
<CASSIO>	<33%>
	Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<33%>
	To the health of our general!
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<34%>
	Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<34%>
	No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God's above all; and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<34%>
	For mine own part,—no offence to the general, nor any man of quality,—I hope to be saved.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<34%>
	Ay; but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and speak well enough.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 3><32%>
<CASSIO>	<34%>
	Why, very well, then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

	Dost thou prate, rogue?
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>

	Let me go, sir,
	Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 2><SCENE 3><34%>
<CASSIO>	<35%>
	Drunk!
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 2><SCENE 3><35%>
<CASSIO>	<36%>
	I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

<SPEECH 46><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<CASSIO>	<39%>
	Ay; past all surgery.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<CASSIO>	<39%>
	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O! I have lost my reputation. I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<CASSIO>	<39%>
	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk! and speak parrot! and squabble, swagger, swear, and discourse fustian with one's own shadow! O thou invisible spirit of wine! if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<CASSIO>	<39%>
	I know not.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 2><SCENE 3><37%>
<CASSIO>	<39%>
	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God! that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains; that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<CASSIO>	<40%>
	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<CASSIO>	<40%>
	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<CASSIO>	<40%>
	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<CASSIO>	<40%>
	You advise me well.
</CASSIO>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 2><SCENE 3><38%>
<CASSIO>	<41%>
	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.

<SPEECH 56><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>

	Ay, but, lady,
	That policy may either last so long,

<SPEECH 69><ACT 3><SCENE 4><60%>
<CASSIO>	<62%>
	Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
	That by your virtuous means I may again
	Exist, and be a member of his love
	Whom I with all the office of my heart
	Entirely honour; I would not be delay'd.
	If my offence be of such mortal kind
	That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
	Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
	Can ransom me into his love again,
	But to know so must be my benefit;
	So shall I clothe me in a forc'd content,
	And shut myself up in some other course
	To fortune's alms.
