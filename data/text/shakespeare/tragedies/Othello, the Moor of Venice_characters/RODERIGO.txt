	Tush! Never tell me; I take it much unkindly
	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<RODERIGO>	<1%>
	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<RODERIGO>	<1%>
	I would not follow him then.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>

	What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
	If he can carry 't thus!

	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<RODERIGO>	<2%>
	What, ho! Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	Signior, is all your family within?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	My name is Roderigo.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	Sir, sir, sir!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	Patience, good sir.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<RODERIGO>	<3%>
	Most grave Brabantio,
	In simple and pure soul I come to you.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<RODERIGO>	<4%>
	Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
	If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent,—
	As partly, I find, it is,—that your fair daughter,
	At this odd-even and dull-watch o' the night,
	Transported with no worse nor better guard
	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,—
	If this be known to you, and your allowance,
	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
	But if you know not this, my manners tell me
	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe,
	That, from the sense of all civility,
	I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
	I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
	Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
	Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
	If she be in her chamber or your house,
	Let loose on me the justice of the state
	For thus deluding you.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<RODERIGO>	<5%>
	Truly, I think they are.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<RODERIGO>	<5%>
	Yes, sir, I have indeed.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 1><5%>
<RODERIGO>	<6%>
	I think I can discover him, if you please
	To get good guard and go along with me.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<RODERIGO>	<8%>
	Signior, it is the Moor.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<RODERIGO>	<18%>
	Iago!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<RODERIGO>	<18%>
	What will I do, think'st thou?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<RODERIGO>	<18%>
	I will incontinently drown myself.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<RODERIGO>	<18%>
	It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<RODERIGO>	<18%>
	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<RODERIGO>	<19%>
	It cannot be.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<RODERIGO>	<20%>
	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<RODERIGO>	<20%>
	Where shall we meet i' the morning?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<RODERIGO>	<20%>
	I'll be with thee betimes.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<RODERIGO>	<20%>
	What say you?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<RODERIGO>	<20%>
	I am changed. I'll sell all my land.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 2><SCENE 1><26%>
<RODERIGO>	<28%>
	With him! why, 'tis not possible.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<RODERIGO>	<29%>
	I cannot believe that in her; she is full of most blessed condition.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 1><27%>
<RODERIGO>	<29%>
	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<RODERIGO>	<29%>
	Well.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<RODERIGO>	<30%>
	I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<RODERIGO>	<30%>
	Adieu.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 2><SCENE 3><33%>
<RODERIGO>	<35%>
	Beat me!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 2><SCENE 3><39%>
<RODERIGO>	<41%>
	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 2><77%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency, than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist; you have told me she has received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well: by this hand, I say, it is very scurvy, and begin to find myself fobbed in it.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona; if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<79%>
	Ay, and said nothing, but what I protest intendment of doing.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 2><78%>
<RODERIGO>	<80%>
	It hath not appeared.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
<RODERIGO>	<80%>
	Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
<RODERIGO>	<80%>
	Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
<RODERIGO>	<80%>
	How do you mean, removing of him?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
<RODERIGO>	<80%>
	And that you would have me do?
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 2><79%>
<RODERIGO>	<81%>
	I will hear further reason for this.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<RODERIGO>	<84%>
	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in 't.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<RODERIGO>	<84%>
	I have no great devotion to the deed;
	And yet he has given me satisfying reasons:
	'Tis but a man gone: forth, my sword; he dies.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 5><SCENE 1><83%>
<RODERIGO>	<85%>
	I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<RODERIGO>	<85%>
	O! I am slain.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<RODERIGO>	<85%>
	O! villain that I am!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<RODERIGO>	<86%>
	O wretched villain!
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<RODERIGO>	<86%>
	Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<RODERIGO>	<86%>
	O! help me here.
</RODERIGO>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<RODERIGO>	<86%>
	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
</RODERIGO>
