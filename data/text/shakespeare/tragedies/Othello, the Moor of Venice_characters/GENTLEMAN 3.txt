	News, lads! our wars are done.
	The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks
	That their designment halts; a noble ship of Venice
	Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance
	On most part of their fleet.

	The ship is here put in,
	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
	Lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello,
	Is come on shore: the Moor himself's at sea,
	And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly
	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
	With foul and violent tempest.

	Come, let's do so;
	For every minute is expectancy
	Of more arrivance.
