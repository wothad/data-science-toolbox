	Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:

<STAGE DIR>
<To Brabantio.>
</STAGE DIR> I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
	We lack'd your counsel and your help to-night.
</DUKE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 3><10%>

	To vouch this, is no proof,

	I think this tale would win my daughter too.
	Good Brabantio,

	Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,
	Which as a grize or step, may help these lovers
	Into your favour.
	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
	What cannot be preserv'd when Fortune takes,
	Patience her injury a mockery makes.
	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

<SPEECH 23><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
<DUKE>	<17%>
	Be it as you shall privately determine,
	Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,

<DUKE>	<17%>
	At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
	Othello, leave some officer behind,

	As doth import you.

	Let it be so.
	Good night to every one. <STAGE DIR>

	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
