	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
	My very noble and approv'd good masters,
	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
	It is most true; true, I have married her:
	The very head and front of my offending
	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace;
	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd
	Their dearest action in the tented field;
	And little of this great world can I speak,
	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
	And therefore little shall I grace my cause
	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
	What conjuration, and what mighty magic,
	For such proceeding I am charg'd withal,
	I won his daughter.

	Not only take away, but let your sentence
	Even fall upon my life.

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<OTHELLO>	<13%>
	Her father lov'd me; oft invited me;
	Still question'd me the story of my life
	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes
	That I have pass'd.
	I ran it through, even from my boyish days
	To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
	Of moving accidents by flood and field,
	Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
	Of being taken by the insolent foe
	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
	And portance in my travel's history;
	Wherein of antres vast and desarts idle,
	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,
	It was my hint to speak, such was the process;
	And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
	The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
	Would Desdemona seriously incline;
	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence;
	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
	She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
	Devour up my discourse. Which I observing,
	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
	But not intentively: I did consent;
	And often did beguile her of her tears,
	When I did speak of some distressful stroke
	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
	She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
	That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
	And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
	I should but teach him how to tell my story,
	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
	She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd,
	And I lov'd her that she did pity them.
	This only is the witchcraft I have us'd:
	Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,

	These present wars against the Ottomites.
	Most humbly therefore bending to your state,

	But to be free and bounteous to her mind;
	And heaven defend your good souls that you think

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
<OTHELLO>	<48%>
	Think, my lord!
	By heaven, he echoes me,
	As if there were some monster in his thought
	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
	I heard thee say but now, thou lik'dst not that,
	When Cassio left my wife; what didst not like?
	And when I told thee he was of my counsel
	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, 'Indeed!'
	And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
	Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
	Show me thy thought.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
<OTHELLO>	<48%>
	I think thou dost;
	And, for I know thou art full of love and honesty,
	And weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath,
	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
	For such things in a false disloyal knave
	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
	They are close delations, working from the heart
	That passion cannot rule.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
<OTHELLO>	<48%>
	I think so too.

<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 3><46%>
<OTHELLO>	<48%>
	Nay, yet there's more in this.
	I pray thee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,

	The worst of words.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 3><47%>
<OTHELLO>	<49%>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 3><48%>
<OTHELLO>	<50%>
	Why, why is this?
	Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy,
	To follow still the changes of the moon
	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
	Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat
	When I shall turn the business of my soul
	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
	Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
	The smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt;
	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
	And, on the proof, there is no more but this,
	Away at once with love or jealousy!
</OTHELLO>

	This fellow's of exceeding honesty,

	To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,
	And have not those soft parts of conversation
	That chamberers have, or, for I am declin'd
	Into the vale of years—yet that's not much—
	She's gone, I am abus'd; and my relief
	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!
	That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
	And not their appetites. I had rather be a toad,
	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
	Than keep a corner in the thing I love
	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
	Prerogativ'd are they less than the base;

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack;
	I swear 'tis better to be much abus'd
	Than but to know 't a little.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 3><SCENE 3><52%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
	I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;
	I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips;
	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
	Let him not know 't and he's not robb'd at all.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	I had been happy, if the general camp,
	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
	So I had nothing known. O! now, for ever
	Farewell the tranquil mind; farewell content!
	Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
	The royal banner, and all quality,
	Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
	The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof;
	Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,
	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
	Than answer my wak'd wrath.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	Make me to see 't; or, at the least, so prove it,
	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
<OTHELLO>	<55%>
	If thou dost slander her and torture me,
	Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
	On horror's head horrors accumulate;
	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz'd;
	For nothing canst thou to damnation add
	Greater than that.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<OTHELLO>	<56%>
	Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<OTHELLO>	<56%>
	By the world,
	I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
	As Dian's visage, is now begrim'd and black
	As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,
	Poison or fire or suffocating streams,
	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<OTHELLO>	<56%>
	Would! nay, I will.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<OTHELLO>	<56%>
	Death and damnation! O!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<OTHELLO>	<57%>
	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<57%>
	O monstrous! monstrous!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 96><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<57%>
	But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 97><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<57%>
	I'll tear her all to pieces.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 98><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<57%>
	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 99><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<58%>
	If it be that,—
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 100><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<OTHELLO>	<58%>
	O! that the slave had forty thousand lives;
	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven:
	'Tis gone.
	Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!
	Yield up, O love! thy crown and hearted throne
	To tyrannous hate. Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
	For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 101><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OTHELLO>	<58%>
	O! blood, blood, blood!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 102><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OTHELLO>	<58%>
	Never, Iago. Like to the Pontick sea,
	Whose icy current and compulsive course
	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
	Till that a capable and wide revenge
	Swallow them up.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneels.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Now, by yond marble heaven,
	In the due reverence of a sacred vow
	I here engage my words.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 103><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OTHELLO>	<58%>
	I greet thy love,
	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
	And will upon the instant put thee to 't:
	Within these three days let me hear thee say
	That Cassio's not alive.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 104><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OTHELLO>	<59%>
	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw
	To furnish me with some swift means of death
	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 105><ACT 3><SCENE 4><57%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	Well, my good lady. <STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> O! hardness to dissemble.
	How do you, Desdemona?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 106><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 107><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
	Hot, hot, and moist; this hand of yours requires
	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
	Much castigation, exercise devout;
	For here's a young and sweating devil here,
	That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
	A frank one.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 108><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	A liberal hand; the hearts of old gave hands,
	But our new heraldry is hands not hearts.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 109><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	What promise, chuck?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 110><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.
	Lend me thy handkerchief.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 111><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	That which I gave you.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	Not?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 3><SCENE 4><58%>
<OTHELLO>	<60%>
	That is a fault.
	That handkerchief
	Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
	She was a charmer, and could almost read
	The thoughts of people; she told her, while she kept it,
	'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
	Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
	Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
	Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt
	After new fancies. She dying gave it me;
	And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
	To give it her. I did so: and take heed on 't;
	Make it a darling like your precious eye;
	To lose't or give't away, were such perdition
	As nothing else could match.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it;
	A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
	The sun to course two hundred compasses,
	In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
	The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,
	And it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful
	Conserv'd of maidens' hearts.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Most veritable; therefore look to 't well.

<SPEECH 116><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Ha! wherefore?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 117><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Is 't lost? is 't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?

<SPEECH 118><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Say you?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	How!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Fetch 't, let me see 't.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	Fetch me the handkerchief; my mind misgives.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>
<OTHELLO>	<61%>
	The handkerchief!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 4><59%>

<SPEECH 126><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	Think so, Iago!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	An unauthoriz'd kiss.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 128><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	Naked a-bed, Iago, and not mean harm?
	It is hypocrisy against the devil:
	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 129><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	What then?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 130><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	She is protectress of her honour too;
	May she give that?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 131><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<OTHELLO>	<65%>
	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:—
	Thou said'st,—O! it comes o'er my memory,

	Boding to all,—he had my handkerchief.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 132><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>

	That's not so good now.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 133><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<OTHELLO>	<66%>
	Hath he said any thing?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 134><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<OTHELLO>	<66%>
	What hath he said?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 135><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<OTHELLO>	<66%>
	What? what?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 136><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<OTHELLO>	<66%>
	With her?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 137><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<OTHELLO>	<66%>
	Lie with her! lie on her! We say, lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome. Handkerchief,—confessions,—handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess: I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is it possible?—Confess!—Handkerchief!—O devil!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 138><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<OTHELLO>	<67%>
	Dost thou mock me?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 139><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<OTHELLO>	<67%>
	A horned man's a monster and a beast.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 140><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<OTHELLO>	<67%>
	Did he confess it?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 141><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<OTHELLO>	<67%>
	O! thou art wise; 'tis certain.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 142><ACT 4><SCENE 1><65%>
<OTHELLO>	<67%>
	Dost thou hear, Iago?
	I will be found most cunning in my patience;
	But—dost thou hear?—most bloody.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 143><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<OTHELLO>	<68%>
	Look! how he laughs already!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 144><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<OTHELLO>	<68%>
	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 145><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<OTHELLO>	<68%>
	Now he importunes him
	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

<SPEECH 146><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<OTHELLO>	<68%>
	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 147><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>

	So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 148><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<OTHELLO>	<69%>
	Have you scored me? Well.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 149><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<OTHELLO>	<69%>
	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 150><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<OTHELLO>	<69%>
	Crying, 'O dear Cassio!' as it were; his gesture imports it.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 151><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<OTHELLO>	<69%>
	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O! I see that nose of yours, but not the dog I shall throw it to.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 152><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OTHELLO>	<69%>
	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
</OTHELLO>

	O! Iago!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 155><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	Was that mine?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 156><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	I would have him nine years a-killing.
	A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 157><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O! the world hath not a sweeter creature; she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 158><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle! An admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 159><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	O! a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a condition!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 160><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<OTHELLO>	<70%>
	Nay, that's certain;—but yet the pity of it, Iago! O! Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 161><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<OTHELLO>	<71%>
	I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!

	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.

	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
	Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
	Committed! O thou public commoner!
	I should make very forges of my cheeks,
	That would to cinders burn up modesty,
	Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
	Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
	The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
	Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
	And will not hear it. What committed!
	Impudent strumpet!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 196><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>

<SPEECH 197><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>

<SPEECH 198><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 199><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
<OTHELLO>	<76%>
	I cry you mercy, then;

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 202><ACT 4><SCENE 3><80%>
<OTHELLO>	<81%>
	Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith; dismiss your attendant there; look it be done.

<SPEECH 204><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>

	It is e'en so.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 205><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<OTHELLO>	<85%>
	'Tis he: O brave Iago, honest and just!
	That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong;
	Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
	And your unblest fate hies; strumpet, I come!
	Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
	Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.

<Exit.>

<SPEECH 206><ACT 5><SCENE 2><87%>
<OTHELLO>	<89%>
	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul;
	Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
	It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,
	Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
	And smooth as monumental alabaster.
	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
	Put out the light, and then put out the light:
	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
	I can again thy former light restore,
	Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
	I know not where is that Promethean heat
	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
	I cannot give it vital growth again,
	It needs must wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
<STAGE DIR>
<Kisses her.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
	Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
	Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
	And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
	So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
	But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,
	It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 207><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>

	Ay, Desdemona.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 208><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>

<SPEECH 209><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<OTHELLO>	<89%>
	If you bethink yourself of any crime

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 210><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<OTHELLO>	<89%>
	Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
	I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
	No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 211><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<OTHELLO>	<89%>
	Ay, I do.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 212><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Amen! with all my heart.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 213><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Hum!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 214><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Think on thy sins.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 215><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Ay, and for that thou diest.

<SPEECH 216><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>

<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Sweet soul, take heed,
	Take heed of perjury; thou'rt on thy death-bed.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 219><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	Yes, presently;
	Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
	For to deny each article with oath
	Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
	That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 220><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	I say, amen.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 221><ACT 5><SCENE 2><89%>
<OTHELLO>	<90%>
	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
	O perjur'd woman! thou dost stone my heart,
	And mak'st me call what I intend to do
	A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
	I saw the handkerchief.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 222><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	He hath confess'd.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 223><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	That he hath us'd thee.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 224><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Ay.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 225><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	No; his mouth is stopp'd:
	Honest Iago hath ta'en order for 't.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 226><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
	Had stomach for them all.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 227><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 228><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Down, strumpet!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 229><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Nay, if you strive,—
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 230><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Being done, there is no pause.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 231><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	It is too late.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 232><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
	I that am cruel am yet merciful;
	I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
	So, so.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 233><ACT 5><SCENE 2><90%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Who's there?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 234><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<91%>
	Yes; 'tis Emilia: by and by. She's dead.
	'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death;
	The noise was high. Ha! no more moving?
	Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were 't good?
	I think she stirs again: no. What's best to do?
	If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife:
	My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife:
	O, insupportable! O heavy hour!
	Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
	Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
	Should yawn at alteration.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 235><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	I had forgot thee: O! come in, Emilia:
	Soft, by and by: let me the curtains draw.
	Where art thou?
<STAGE DIR>
<Unlocks the door.>
</STAGE DIR>

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 236><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	What! now?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 237><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	It is the very error of the moon;
	She comes more near the earth than she was wont,
	And makes men mad.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 238><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	Roderigo kill'd!
	And Cassio kill'd?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 239><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
	And sweet revenge grows harsh.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 240><ACT 5><SCENE 2><91%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	That! what?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 241><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	Why, how should she be murder'd?
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 242><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	You heard her say herself it was not I.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 243><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<92%>
	She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
	'Twas I that kill'd her.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 244><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 245><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	She was false as water.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 246><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Cassio did tup her; ask thy husband else.
	O! I were damn'd beneath all depth in bell
	But that I did proceed upon just grounds
	To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 247><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Thy husband.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 248><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
	If heaven would make me such another world
	Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
	I'd not have sold her for it.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 249><ACT 5><SCENE 2><92%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
	An honest man he is, and hates the slime
	That sticks on filthy deeds.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 250><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	What needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 251><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	He, woman;
	I say, thy husband: dost understand the word?
	My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 252><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Ha!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 253><ACT 5><SCENE 2><93%>
<OTHELLO>	<93%>
	Peace! you were best.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 254><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<OTHELLO>	<94%>
	Nay, stare not, masters; it is true, indeed.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 255><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<OTHELLO>	<95%>
	O! O! O!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 256><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<OTHELLO>	<95%>
	O! she was foul.
	I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,
	Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
	I know this act shows terrible and grim.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 257><ACT 5><SCENE 2><94%>
<OTHELLO>	<95%>
	'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
	That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
	A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
	And she did gratify his amorous works
	With that recognizance and pledge of love
	Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand:
	It was a handkerchief, an antique token
	My father gave my mother.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 258><ACT 5><SCENE 2><95%>
<OTHELLO>	<96%>
	Are there no stones in heaven
	But what serve for the thunder? Precious villain!
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 259><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<OTHELLO>	<96%>
	I am not valiant neither,
	But every puny whipster gets my sword.
	But why should honour outlive honesty?
	Let it go all.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 260><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<OTHELLO>	<96%>
	I have another weapon in this chamber;
	It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook's temper.
	O! here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 261><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<OTHELLO>	<96%>
	Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
	Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 262><ACT 5><SCENE 2><96%>
<OTHELLO>	<97%>
	Behold! I have a weapon;
	A better never did itself sustain
	Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
	That with this little arm, and this good sword,
	I have made my way through more impediments
	Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
	Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
	Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
	Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
	And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
	Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
	Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
	And he retires. Where should Othello go?
	Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
	Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
	This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
	And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
	Even like thy chastity.
	O! cursed, cursed slave. Whip me, ye devils,
	From the possession of this heavenly sight!
	Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
	Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
	O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
	Oh! Oh! Oh!

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 263><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>

	That's he that was Othello; here I am.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 264><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<OTHELLO>	<97%>
	I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
	If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 265><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	I am not sorry neither; I'd have thee live;
	For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 266><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	Why, any thing:
	An honourable murderer, if you will;
	For nought did I in hate, but all in honour.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 267><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	Ay.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 268><ACT 5><SCENE 2><97%>
<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
	Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 269><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	Well, thou dost best.

<OTHELLO>	<98%>
	O the pernicious caitiff!

</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 272><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<OTHELLO>	<99%>
	O fool! fool! fool!

<SPEECH 273><ACT 5><SCENE 2><98%>
<OTHELLO>	<99%>
	Soft you; a word or two before you go.
	I have done the state some service, and they know't;
	No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
	When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
	Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
	Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak
	Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well;
	Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,
	Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
	Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
	Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu'd eyes
	Albeit unused to the melting mood,
	Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
	Their med'cinable gum. Set you down this;
	And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
	Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
	Beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state,
	I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
	And smote him thus.
</OTHELLO>

<SPEECH 274><ACT 5><SCENE 2><99%>
<OTHELLO>	<99%>
	I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee; no way but this,
