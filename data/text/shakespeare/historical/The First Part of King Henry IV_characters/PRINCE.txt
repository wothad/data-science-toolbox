	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colour'd taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.

	That when he please again to be himself,
	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
	If all the year were playing holidays,
	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
	So, when this loose behaviour I throw off,
	And pay the debt I never promised,
	By how much better than my word I am
	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.

	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,—by the Lord, so they call me,—and when I am king of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than—'Eight shillings and sixpence,' and—'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition,—'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling 'Francis!' that his tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent.

I am not yet of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he, and answers, 'Some fourteen,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.

</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 114><ACT 2><SCENE 4><48%>
<PRINCE>	<48%>
	The man, I do assure you, is not here,
	For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
	And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee,
	That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
	Send him to answer thee, or any man,
	For anything he shall be charg'd withal:
	And so let me entreat you leave the house.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 115><ACT 2><SCENE 4><48%>
<PRINCE>	<48%>
	It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
	He shall be answerable; and so farewell.

<SPEECH 116><ACT 2><SCENE 4><48%>

<PRINCE>	<48%>
	This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's.
	Go, call him forth.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 118><ACT 2><SCENE 4><48%>
<PRINCE>	<49%>
	Hark, how hard he fetches breath.
	Search his pockets. <STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> What hast thou found?
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 119><ACT 2><SCENE 4><48%>
<PRINCE>	<49%>
	Let's see what they be: read them.

</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 120><ACT 2><SCENE 4><49%>
<PRINCE>	<49%>
	O monstrous! but one half-pennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close; we'll read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot; and, I know, his death will be a march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning; and so good morrow, Peto.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<PRINCE>	<58%>
	So please your majesty, I would I could
	Quit all offences with as clear excuse
	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
	Myself of many I am charg'd withal:
	Yet such extenuation let me beg,
	As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,
	Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
	By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,
	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
	Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
	Find pardon on my true submission.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 122><ACT 3><SCENE 2><60%>
<PRINCE>	<60%>
	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
	Be more myself.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 123><ACT 3><SCENE 2><61%>
<PRINCE>	<62%>
	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
	And God forgive them, that so much have sway'd
	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
	I will redeem all this on Percy's head,
	And in the closing of some glorious day
	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
	When I will wear a garment all of blood
	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
	Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
	And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
	That this same child of honour and renown,
	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
	And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
	For every honour sitting on his helm,—
	Would they were multitudes, and on my head
	My shames redoubled!—for the time will come
	That I shall make this northern youth exchange
	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
	And I will call him to so strict account
	That he shall render every glory up,
	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
	This, in the name of God, I promise here:
	The which, if he be pleas'd I shall perform,
	I do beseech your majesty may salve
	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
	If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

<SPEECH 134><ACT 3><SCENE 3><68%>
<PRINCE>	<68%>
	O! if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees. But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, or honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal, if there were any thing in thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded; if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it, you will not pocket up wrong. Art thou not ashamed?

	Jack, meet me to-morrow in the Temple-hall
	At two o'clock in the afternoon:
	There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive

	In both our armies there is many a soul
	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
	This present enterprise set off his head,
	I do not think a braver gentleman,
	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
	More daring or more bold, is now alive
	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
	I have a truant been to chivalry;
	And so I hear he doth account me too;
	Yet this before my father's majesty—
	I am content that he shall take the odds
	Of his great name and estimation,
	And will, to save the blood on either side,
	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 148><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<PRINCE>	<86%>
	It will not be accepted, on my life.

<SPEECH 151><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<PRINCE>	<91%>
	What! stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:

</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 152><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>

<SPEECH 157><ACT 5><SCENE 4><93%>
<PRINCE>	<93%>
	By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster;

	Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like

<PRINCE>	<94%>
	O God! they did me too much injury
	That ever said I hearken'd for your death.

	Which would have been as speedy in your end
	As all the poisonous potions in the world,
	And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.

<SPEECH 161><ACT 5><SCENE 4><94%>

<PRINCE>	<95%>
	Why, then, I see
	A very valiant rebel of that name.
	I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
	To share with me in glory any more:
	Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
	Nor can one England brook a double reign,
	Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 163><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<PRINCE>	<95%>
	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
	And all the budding honours on thy crest
	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 164><ACT 5><SCENE 4><95%>
<PRINCE>	<96%>
	For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart!
	Ill-weav'd ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
	When that this body did contain a spirit,
	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
	But now, two paces of the vilest earth
	Is room enough: this earth, that bears thee dead,
	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
	But let my favours hide thy mangled face,
	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
	Thy ignomy sleep with thee in the grave,
	But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
<STAGE DIR>
<He spies Falstaff on the ground.>
</STAGE DIR>
	What! old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
	I could have better spar'd a better man.
	O! I should have a heavy miss of thee
	If I were much in love with vanity.
	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
	Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 165><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>

</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 166><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>
<PRINCE>	<97%>
	I did; I saw him dead,
	Breathless and bleeding on the ground.
	Art thou alive? or is it fantasy
	That plays upon our eyesight? I prithee, speak;
	We will not trust our eyes without our ears:
	Thou art not what thou seem'st.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 167><ACT 5><SCENE 4><97%>

<A retreat is sounded.>

<SPEECH 169><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<PRINCE>	<99%>
	The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
	The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
	The noble Percy slain, and all his men
	Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
	And falling from a hill he was so bruis'd
	That the pursuers took him. At my tent
	The Douglas is, and I beseech your Grace
	I may dispose of him.
</PRINCE>

<SPEECH 170><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<PRINCE>	<99%>
	Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
	This honourable bounty shall belong.
	Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
	Up to his pleasure, ransomless, and free:
	His valour shown upon our crests to-day
	Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,
	Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
