	What news?

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
<BARDOLPH>	<41%>
	Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
<BARDOLPH>	<41%>
	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before; I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.

<Pointing to his face.>
</STAGE DIR> My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations?
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
<BARDOLPH>	<42%>
	What think you they portend?
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
<BARDOLPH>	<42%>
	Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><47%>

<BARDOLPH>	<64%>
	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><63%>
<BARDOLPH>	<64%>
	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 3><64%>
<BARDOLPH>	<64%>
	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

<BARDOLPH>	<66%>
	Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><74%>
<BARDOLPH>	<75%>
	This bottle makes an angel.
</BARDOLPH>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 2><75%>
<BARDOLPH>	<75%>
	I will, captain: farewell.
