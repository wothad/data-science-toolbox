	You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.

	Will it never be morning?

	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.

	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 7><48%>
<ORLEANS>	<49%>
	No more, cousin.

	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.

	By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
</ORLEANS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
<ORLEANS>	<51%>
	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
</ORLEANS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
<ORLEANS>	<51%>
	He never did harm, that I heard of.
</ORLEANS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
<ORLEANS>	<51%>
	I know him to be valiant.

	What's he?
</ORLEANS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 7><50%>
<ORLEANS>	<51%>
	He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.

	That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 7><51%>
<ORLEANS>	<52%>
	Foolish curs! that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples. You may as well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
</ORLEANS>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 7><52%>
<ORLEANS>	<52%>
	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
