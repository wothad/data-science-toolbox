	O peace, Prince Dauphin!
	You are too much mistaken in this king.
	Question your Grace the late ambassadors,
	With what great state he heard their embassy,
	How well supplied with noble counsellors,
	How modest in exception, and, withal
	How terrible in constant resolution,
	And you shall find his vanities forespent
	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
	That shall first spring and be most delicate.
</CONSTABLE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 5><40%>

	And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
	Let us not live in France; let us quit all,

	Dieu de battailes! where have they this mettle?
	Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull,
	On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
	Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
	A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
	Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
	Seem frosty? O! for honour of our land,
	Let us not hang like roping icicles
	Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
	Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields;
	Poor we may call them in their native lords.
</CONSTABLE>

	This becomes the great.
	Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
	His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
	For I am sure when he shall see our army
	He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
	And for achievement offer us his ransom.

	To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
	Do but behold yon poor and starved band,

	Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
	There is not work enough for all our hands;
	Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
	To give each naked curtal-axe a stain,
	That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
	And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
	The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
	That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
	Who in unnecessary action swarm
	About our squares of battle, were enow
	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
	Though we upon this mountain's basis by
	Took stand for idle speculation:
	But that our honours must not. What's to say?
	A very little little let us do,
	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
	The tucket sonance and the note to mount:
	For our approach shall so much dare the field,
	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
