<MESSENGER>	<67%>
	From France to England. Never such a power
	For any foreign preparation
	Was levied in the body of a land.
	The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
	For when you should be told they do prepare,
	The tidings come that they are all arriv'd.

<MESSENGER>	<68%>
	My liege, her ear
	Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died
	Your noble mother; and, as I hear, my lord,
	The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
	Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
	I idly heard; if true or false I know not.

	My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,

<MESSENGER>	<90%>
	Be of good comfort: for the great supply
	That was expected by the Dauphin here,
	Are wrack'd three nights ago on Goodwin sands.
	This news was brought to Richard but even now.
	The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.

<MESSENGER>	<93%>
	The Count Melun is slain; the English lords,
	By his persuasion, are again fall'n off;
	And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
	Are cast away and sunk, on Goodwin sands.
</MESSENGER>
