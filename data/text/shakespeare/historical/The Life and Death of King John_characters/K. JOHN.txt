	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept

	Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
	And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
	That as a waist do girdle you about,
	By the compulsion of their ordinance
	By this time from their fixed beds of lime
	Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
	For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
	But on the sight of us your lawful king,—
	Who painfully with much expedient march
	Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
	To save unscratch'd your city's threaten'd cheeks,—
	Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle;
	And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
	To make a shaking fever in your walls,
	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
	To make a faithless error in your ears:
	Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
	And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
	Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
	Crave harbourage within your city walls.

	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet;

	I had a thing to say, but let it go:
	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
	To give me audience: if the midnight bell
	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
	Sound one into the drowsy race of night;
	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
	Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
	A passion hateful to my purposes;
	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
	Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
	But ah! I will not: yet I love thee well;
	And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.

	And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread

	Out of my sight, and never see me more!
	My nobles leave me; and my state is brav'd,
	Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
	Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
	This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
	Hostility and civil tumult reigns
	Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 80><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
<K. JOHN>	<73%>
	Doth Arthur live? O! haste thee to the peers,
	Throw this report on their incensed rage,
	And make them tame to their obedience.
	Forgive the comment that my passion made
	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
	And foul imaginary eyes of blood
	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
	O! answer not; but to my closet bring
	The angry lords, with all expedient haste.
	I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<K. JOHN>	<80%>
	Thus have I yielded up into your hand
	The circle of my glory.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<K. JOHN>	<80%>
	Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
	And from his holiness use all your power
	To stop their marches 'fore we are inflam'd.
	Our discontented counties do revolt,
	Our people quarrel with obedience,
	Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
	To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
	This inundation of mistemper'd humour
	Rests by you only to be qualified:
	Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
	That present medicine must be minister'd,
	Or overthrow incurable ensues.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 83><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
	Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
	Say that before Ascension-day at noon
	My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
	I did suppose it should be on constraint;
	But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.

</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 84><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
	Would not my lords return to me again
	After they heard young Arthur was alive?
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 85><ACT 5><SCENE 1><81%>
<K. JOHN>	<81%>
	That villain Hubert told me he did live.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 86><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<K. JOHN>	<82%>
	The legate of the pope hath been with me,
	And I have made a happy peace with him;
	And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
	Led by the Dauphin.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 87><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<K. JOHN>	<83%>
	Have thou the ordering of this present time.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 88><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<K. JOHN>	<89%>
	How goes the day with us? O! tell me, Hubert.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<K. JOHN>	<89%>
	This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
	Lies heavy on me: O! my heart is sick.

</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<K. JOHN>	<90%>
	Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 91><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<K. JOHN>	<90%>
	Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
	And will not let me welcome this good news.
	Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
	Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 5><SCENE 7><96%>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
	Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
	It would not out at windows, nor at doors.
	There is so hot a summer in my bosom
	That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
	I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
	Upon a parchment, and against this fire
	Do I shrink up.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 93><ACT 5><SCENE 7><96%>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
	Poison'd, ill-fare; dead, forsook, cast off;
	And none of you will bid the winter come
	To thrust his icy fingers in my maw;
	Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
	Through my burn'd bosom; nor entreat the north
	To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
	And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much:
	I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
	And so ingrateful you deny me that.
</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 94><ACT 5><SCENE 7><97%>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
	The salt in them is hot.
	Within me is a hell; and there the poison
	Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize
	On unreprievable condemned blood.

</K. JOHN>

<SPEECH 95><ACT 5><SCENE 7><97%>
<K. JOHN>	<97%>
	O cousin! thou art come to set mine eye:
	The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
	And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
	Are turned to one thread, one little hair;
	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
	Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
	And then all this thou seest is but a clod
	And module of confounded royalty.
</K. JOHN>
