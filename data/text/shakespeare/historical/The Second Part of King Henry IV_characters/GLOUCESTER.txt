	I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<72%>
	I do not know, my lord.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 4><72%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<72%>
	No, my good lord; he is in presence here.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<75%>
	Comfort, your majesty!

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 4><75%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<76%>
	The people fear me; for they do observe
	Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
	The seasons change their manners, as the year
	Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.

	He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.

<GLOUCESTER>	<87%>
	Good morrow, cousin.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 2><86%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<87%>
	O! good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;
	And I dare swear you borrow not that face
	Of seeming sorrow; it is sure your own.
</GLOUCESTER>
