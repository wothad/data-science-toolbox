	New customs,
	Though they be never so ridiculous,
	Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.

	They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,
	That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
	Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.

	'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases
	Are grown so catching.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><17%>
<SANDS>	<18%>
	The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they're going:
	For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now
	An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
	A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
	And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,
	Held current music too.

	No, my lord;

	He may, my lord; he has wherewithal: in him
	Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
	Men of his way should be most liberal;
	They are set here for examples.

	I am your lordship's.

	Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal
	But half my lay-thoughts in him, some of these
	Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
	I think would better please 'em: by my life,
	They are a sweet society of fair ones.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>
<SANDS>	<19%>
	I would I were;
	They should find easy penance.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>

	As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

	By my faith,
	And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:

	If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
	I had it from my father.

	O! very mad, exceeding mad; in love too:
	But he would bite none; just as I do now,
	He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 4><19%>

	For my little cure,

	Your Grace is noble:
	Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
	And save me so much talking.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
<SANDS>	<20%>
	The red wine first must rise
	In their fair cheeks, my lord; then, we shall have 'em
	Talk us to silence.
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
<SANDS>	<20%>
	Yes, if I make my play.
	Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,
	For 'tis to such a thing,—
</SANDS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 1><SCENE 4><20%>
<SANDS>	<21%>
	I told your Grace they would talk anon.
