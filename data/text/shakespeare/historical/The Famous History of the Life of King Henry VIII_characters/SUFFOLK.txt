<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<SUFFOLK>	<30%>
	No; his conscience
	Has crept too near another lady.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<SUFFOLK>	<30%>
	Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.

	For me, my lords,
	I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed.
	As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
	If the king please; his curses and his blessings
	Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
	I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
	To him that made him proud, the pope.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 2><31%>

	Which of the peers
	Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
	Strangely neglected? when did he regard

	Out of himself?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>

	The cardinal's letter to the pope miscarried,
	And came to the eye o' the king; wherein was read,
	That the cardinal did entreat his holiness
	To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if
	It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive
	My king is tangled in affection to
	A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>

	There's order given for her coronation:
	Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
	She is a gallant creature, and complete
	In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her
	Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
	In it be memoriz'd.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<SUFFOLK>	<54%>
	No, no;
	There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
	Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
	Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
	Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
	To second all his plot. I do assure you
	The king cried Ha! at this.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<SUFFOLK>	<55%>
	He is return'd in his opinions, which
	Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
	Together with all famous colleges
	Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
	His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
	Her coronation. Katharine no more
	Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager,
	And widow to Prince Arthur.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<SUFFOLK>	<55%>
	He has; and we shall see him
	For it an archbishop.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<SUFFOLK>	<55%>
	'Tis so.
	The cardinal!

</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<SUFFOLK>	<56%>
	May be he hears the king
	Does whet his anger to him.

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>

	Then, that without the knowledge
	Either of king or council, when you went

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 2><63%>
<SUFFOLK>	<64%>
	Lord Cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
	Because all those things you have done of late,
	By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
	Fall into the compass of a præmunire,
	That therefore such a writ be su'd against you;
	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
	Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
</SUFFOLK>

	Sir, I did never win of you before.

	God safely quit her of her burden, and

</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 1><82%>
<SUFFOLK>	<82%>
	I wish your highness

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	Nay, my lord,
	That cannot be: you are a counsellor,
	And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.

	'Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told ye all,
