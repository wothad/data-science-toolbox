	My life itself, and the best heart of it,
	Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level

	That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person

	Things done well,

	Of this commission? I believe, not any.
	We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
	And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
	A trembling contribution! Why, we take
	From every tree, lop, bark, and part o' the timber;
	And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
	The air will drink the sap. To every county
	Where this is question'd, send our letters, with
	Free pardon to each man that has denied

	It grieves many:
	The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker,
	To nature none more bound; his training such
	That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,
	And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
	When these so noble benefits shall prove
	Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,
	They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
	Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
	Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
	Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find
	His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
	Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
	That once were his, and is become as black
	As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear—
	This was his gentleman in trust—of him
	Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
	The fore-recited practices; whereof

	Carried herself towards me.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
<K. HENRY>	<44%>
	My Lord Cardinal,
	I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
	I free you from't. You are not to be taught
	That you have many enemies, that know not
	Why they are so, but, like to village curs,
	Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
	The queen is put in anger. You're excus'd:
	But will you be more justified? you ever
	Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never
	Desir'd it to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
	The passages made toward it. On my honour,
	I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
	And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,
	I will be bold with time and your attention:
	Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
	My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness,
	Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
	By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,
	Who had been hither sent on the debating
	A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
	Our daughter Mary. I' the progress of this business,
	Ere a determinate resolution, he—
	I mean, the bishop—did require a respite;
	Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
	Whether our daughter were legitimate,
	Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
	Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
	The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
	Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
	The region of my breast; which forc'd such way,
	That many maz'd considerings did throng,
	And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
	I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had
	Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
	If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should
	Do no more offices of life to't than
	The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
	Or died where they were made, or shortly after
	This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought
	This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
	Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
	Be gladded in't by me. Then follows that
	I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
	By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
	Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
	The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
	Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
	Now present here together; that's to say,
	I meant to rectify my conscience, which
	I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,
	By all the rev'rend fathers of the land
	And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private
	With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
	How under my oppression I did reek,
	When I first mov'd you.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 2><SCENE 4><45%>
<K. HENRY>	<45%>
	I have spoke long: be pleas'd yourself to say
	How far you satisfied me.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 2><SCENE 4><45%>
<K. HENRY>	<46%>
	Then I mov'd you,
	My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
	To make this present summons. Unsolicited
	I left no reverend person in this court;
	But by particular consent proceeded
	Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on;
	For no dislike i' the world against the person
	Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
	Of my alleged reasons drive this forward.
	Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
	And kingly dignity, we are contented
	To wear our mortal state to come with her,
	Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
	That's paragon'd o' the world.

<SPEECH 42><ACT 2><SCENE 4><46%>
<K. HENRY>	<46%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> I may perceive
	These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
	This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
	My learn'd and well-beloved servant Cranmer,
	Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,
	My comfort comes along. Break up the court:
	I say, set on.

	What piles of wealth hath he accumulated

	Saw you the cardinal?
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 2><56%>
<K. HENRY>	<57%>
	It may well be:
	There is a mutiny in 's mind. This morning
	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
	As I requir'd; and wot you what I found
	There, on my conscience, put unwittingly?
	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
	Rich stuffs and ornaments of household, which
	I find at such a proud rate that it out-speaks
	Possession of a subject.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<K. HENRY>	<57%>
	If we did think
	His contemplation were above the earth,
	And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
	Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
	His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
	His serious considering.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<K. HENRY>	<57%>
	Good my lord,
	You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
	Of your best graces in your mind, the which
	You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
	To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
	To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
	I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
	To have you therein my companion.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<K. HENRY>	<58%>
	You have said well.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><57%>
<K. HENRY>	<58%>
	'Tis well said again;
	And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
	And yet words are no deeds. My father lov'd you:
	He said he did; and with his deed did crown
	His word upon you. Since I had my office,
	I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
	Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
	But par'd my present havings, to bestow
	My bounties upon you.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<K. HENRY>	<58%>
	Have I not made you
	The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me
	If what I now pronounce you have found true;
	And if you may confess it, say withal,
	If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<K. HENRY>	<59%>
	Fairly answer'd;
	A loyal and obedient subject is
	Therein illustrated; the honour of it
	Does pay the act of it, as, i' the contrary,
	The foulness is the punishment. I presume
	That as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
	My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more
	On you than any; so your hand and heart,
	Your brain, and every function of your power,
	Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
	As 'twere in love's particular, be more
	To me, your friend, than any.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>

	Ah! my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,

	I have, and most unwillingly, of late
	Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
	Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,
	Have mov'd us and our council, that you shall
	This morning come before us; where, I know,
	You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
	But that, till further trial in those charges
	Which will require your answer, you must take
	Your patience to you, and be well contented

	Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame,
	What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd
	You would have given me your petition, that
	I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
	Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,
	Without indurance, further.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 5><SCENE 1><84%>
<K. HENRY>	<84%>
	Know you not
	How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
	Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
	Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
	The justice and the truth o' the question carries
	The due o' the verdict with it. At what ease
	Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
	To swear against you? such things have been done.
	You are potently oppos'd, and with a malice
	Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
	I mean in perjur'd witness, than your master,

	Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
	The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
	Will render you no remedy, this ring

	Ha! 'Tis he, indeed:
	Is this the honour they do one another?
	'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
	They had parted so much honesty among 'em,—
	At least, good manners,—as not thus to suffer
	A man of his place, and so near our favour,
	To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,
	And at the door too, like a post with packets.
	By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:
	Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;
	We shall hear more anon.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<K. HENRY>	<92%>
	You were ever good at sudden commendations,
	Bishop of Winchester; but know, I come not
	To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;
	They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
	To me you cannot reach; you play the spaniel,
	And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
	But, whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for, I'm sure
	Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
<STAGE DIR>
<To Cranmer.>
</STAGE DIR> Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest
	He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:
	By all that's holy, he had better starve
	Than but once think this place becomes thee not.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 74><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<K. HENRY>	<92%>
	No, sir, it does not please me.
	I had thought I had had men of some understanding
	And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
	Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
	This good man,—few of you deserve that title,—
	This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
	At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?
	Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
	Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
	Power as he was a counsellor to try him,
	Not as a groom. There's some of ye, I see,
	More out of malice than integrity,
	Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
	Which ye shall never have while I live.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 5><SCENE 3><92%>
<K. HENRY>	<93%>
	Well, well, my lords, respect him;
	Take him, and use him well; he's worthy of it.
	I will say thus much for him, if a prince
	May be beholding to a subject, I
	Am, for his love and service, so to him.
	Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:
	Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,
	I have a suit which you must not deny me;
	That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,
	You must be godfather, and answer for her.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 76><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<K. HENRY>	<93%>
	Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons: you shall have two noble partners with you; the old Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will these please you?
	Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,
	Embrace and love this man.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 77><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<K. HENRY>	<93%>
	Good man! those joyful tears show thy true heart:
	The common voice, I see, is verified
	Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury
	A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'
	Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
	To have this young one made a Christian.
	As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;
	So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	Thank you, good lord archbishop:
	What is her name?
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	Stand up, lord.
<STAGE DIR>
<The King kisses the Child.>
</STAGE DIR>
	With this kiss take my blessing; God protect thee!
	Into whose hand I give thy life.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 80><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<K. HENRY>	<97%>
	My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:
	I thank ye heartily: so shall this lady
	When she has so much English.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 81><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<K. HENRY>	<99%>
	Thou speakest wonders.
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 82><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<K. HENRY>	<99%>
	O lord archbishop!
	Thou hast made me now a man: never, before
	This happy child, did I get any thing.
	This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me,
	That when I am in heaven, I shall desire
	To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
	I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,
	And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
	I have receiv'd much honour by your presence,
	And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
	Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye;
	She will be sick else. This day, no man think
	He has business at his house; for all shall stay:
	This little one shall make it holiday.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt.>
