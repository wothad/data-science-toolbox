<CAMPEIUS>	<33%>
	Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
	You are so noble. To your highness' hand
	I tender my commission, by whose virtue,—
	The court of Rome commanding,—you, my Lord
	Cardinal of York, are join'd with me, their servant,
	In the impartial judging of this business.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<34%>
	My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
	In this man's place before him?
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Was he not held a learned man?
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<34%>
	Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then
	Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<34%>
	They will not stick to say, you envied him,
	And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
	Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him
	That he ran mad and died.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><41%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<41%>
	His Grace
	Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,
	It's fit this royal session do proceed,
	And that, without delay, their arguments
	Be now produc'd and heard.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><42%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<43%>
	The queen is obstinate,
	Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
	Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
	She's going away.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><46%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<46%>
	So please your highness,
	The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
	That we adjourn this court till further day:
	Mean while must be an earnest motion
	Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
	She intends unto his holiness.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<49%>
	Most honour'd madam,
	My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
	Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace,
	Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
	Both of his truth and him,—which was too far,—
	Offers, as I do, in sign of peace,
	His service and his counsel.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<50%>
	I would your Grace
	Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<50%>
	Put your main cause into the king's protection;
	He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
	Both for your honour better and your cause;
	For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
	You'll part away disgrac'd.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<50%>
	Your rage mistakes us.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<51%>
	Your fears are worse.
</CAMPEIUS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<CAMPEIUS>	<52%>
	Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues
	With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,
	As yours was put into you, ever casts
	Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;
	Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please
	To trust us in your business, we are ready
	To use our utmost studies in your service.
</CAMPEIUS>
