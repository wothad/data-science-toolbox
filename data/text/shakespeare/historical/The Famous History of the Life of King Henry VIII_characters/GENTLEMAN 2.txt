<SPEECH 1><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<23%>
	O! God save ye.
	E'en to the hall, to hear what shall become
	Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<23%>
	Were you there?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<23%>
	Pray speak what has happen'd.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<24%>
	Is he found guilty?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<24%>
	I am sorry for 't.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 1><23%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<24%>
	But, pray, how pass'd it?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<24%>
	That was he
	That fed him with his prophecies?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<24%>
	After all this how did he bear himself?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<25%>
	I do not think he fears death.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<25%>
	Certainly
	The cardinal is the end of this.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<25%>
	That trick of state
	Was a deep envious one.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<25%>
	All the commons
	Hate him perniciously, and o' my conscience,
	Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
	They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
	The mirror of all courtesy;—
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<25%>
	Let's stand close, and behold him.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<28%>
	If the duke be guiltless,
	'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
	Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
	Greater than this.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<28%>
	This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
	A strong faith to conceal it.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<28%>
	I am confident:
	You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
	A buzzing of a separation
	Between the king and Katharine?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 1><28%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<28%>
	But that slander, sir,
	Is found a truth now; for it grows again
	Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
	The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
	Or some about him near, have, out of malice
	To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
	That will undo her: to confirm this too,
	Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd, and lately;
	As all think, for this business.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<29%>
	I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
	That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
	Will have his will, and she must fall.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<68%>
	So are you.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<68%>
	'Tis all my business. At our last encounter
	The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<68%>
	'Tis well: the citizens,
	I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds,
	As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward,
	In celebration of this day with shows,
	Pageants, and sights of honour.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<68%>
	May I be bold to ask what that contains,
	That paper in your hand?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<68%>
	I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
	I should have been beholding to your paper.
	But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
	The princess dowager? how goes her business?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<69%>
	Alas! good lady!
<STAGE DIR>
<Trumpets.>
</STAGE DIR>
	The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.
<STAGE DIR>
<Hautboys.>
</STAGE DIR>

<The Order of the Coronation.>
	A lively flourish of trumpets.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<70%>
	A royal train, believe me. These I know;
	Who's that that bears the sceptre?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<70%>
	A bold brave gentleman. That should be
	The Duke of Suffolk?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<70%>
	And that my Lord of Norfolk?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<70%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Looking on the Queen.>
</STAGE DIR> Heaven bless thee!
	Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
	Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
	Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
	And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
	I cannot blame his conscience.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<70%>
	Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
	I take it, she that carries up the train
	Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<71%>
	Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
	And sometimes falling ones.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 4><SCENE 1><70%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<71%>
	You saw
	The ceremony?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<71%>
	Good sir, speak it to us.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 4><SCENE 1><71%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<72%>
	But, what follow'd?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<72%>
	What two reverend bishops
	Were those that went on each side of the queen?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<72%>
	He of Winchester
	Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
	The virtuous Cranmer.
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<73%>
	Who may that be, I pray you?
</GENTLEMAN 2>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 4><SCENE 1><72%>
<GENTLEMAN 2>	<73%>
	He will deserve more.
</GENTLEMAN 2>
