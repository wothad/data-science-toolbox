	And for me,
	I have no further gone in this than by

	'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
	That virtue must go through. We must not stint

	By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
	Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
	Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
	For our best act. If we shall stand still,
	In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,

	Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom

	Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
	The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
	Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
	The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
	I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms
	Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,
	Invited by your noble self, hath sent
	One general tongue unto us, this good man,
	This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;
	Whom once more I present unto your highness.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>

	I do profess
	You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
	Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects
	Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
	O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:
	I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
	For you or any: how far I have proceeded,
	Or how far further shall, is warranted
	By a commission from the consistory,
	Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
	That I have blown this coal: I do deny it.
	The king is present: if it be known to him
	That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
	And worthily, my falsehood; yea, as much
	As you have done my truth. If he know
	That I am free of your report, he knows
	I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
	It lies to cure me; and the cure is, to
	Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
	His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
	You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking,
	And to say so no more.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 2><SCENE 4><43%>
<WOLSEY>	<43%>
	Most gracious sir,
	In humblest manner I require your highness,
	That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
	Of all these ears,—for where I am robb'd and bound
	There must I be unloos'd, although not there
	At once, and fully satisfied,—whether ever I
	Did broach this business to your highness, or
	Laid any scruple in your way, which might
	Induce you to the question on't? or ever
	Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
	A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
	Be to the prejudice of her present state,
	Or touch of her good person?

<WOLSEY>	<48%>
	Noble lady,
	I am sorry my integrity should breed,—
	And service to his majesty and you,—
	So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
	We come not by the way of accusation,
	To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
	Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,
	You have too much, good lady; but to know
	How you stand minded in the weighty difference
	Between the king and you; and to deliver,
	Like free and honest men, our just opinions
	And comforts to your cause.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<WOLSEY>	<49%>
	Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
	Your hopes and friends are infinite.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 1><49%>
<WOLSEY>	<50%>
	He tells you rightly.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>

	Madam, this is a mere distraction;
	You turn the good we offer into envy.

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 1><50%>
<WOLSEY>	<51%>
	Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<WOLSEY>	<51%>
	Pray hear me.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 1><51%>
<WOLSEY>	<52%>
	If your Grace
	Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
	You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
	Upon what cause, wrong you? alas! our places,
	The way of our profession is against it:
	We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow them.
	For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
	How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
	Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
	The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
	So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
	They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
	I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
	A soul as even as a calm: pray think us
	Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<WOLSEY>	<58%>
	My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
	Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
	My studied purposes requite; which went
	Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
	Have ever come too short of my desires,
	Yet fil'd with my abilities. Mine own ends
	Have been mine so, that evermore they pointed
	To the good of your most sacred person and
	The profit of the state. For your great graces
	Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
	Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
	My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
	Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
	Till death, that winter, kill it.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 2><58%>
<WOLSEY>	<59%>
	I do profess,
	That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
	More than mine own; that am, have, and will be.
	Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
	And throw it from their soul; though perils did
	Abound as thick as thought could make 'em, and
	Appear in forms more horrid, yet my duty,
	As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
	Should the approach of this wild river break,
	And stand unshaken yours.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 2><59%>
<WOLSEY>	<59%>
	What should this mean?
	What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
	He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
	Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
	Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
	Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
	I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
	This paper has undone me! 'Tis the account
	Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
	For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
	And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
	Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
	Made me put this main secret in the packet
	I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
	No new device to beat this from his brains?
	I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
	A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
	Will bring me off again. What's this?—'To the Pope!'
	The letter, as I live, with all the business
	I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
	I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
	And from that full meridian of my glory,
	I haste now to my setting: I shall fall

	And no man see me more.

<WOLSEY>	<60%>
	Till I find more than will or words to do it,

	Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
	Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
	You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
	In time will find their fit rewards. That seal
	You ask with such a violence, the king—
	Mine and your master—with his own hand gave me;
	Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
	During my life; and to confirm his goodness,

	This and all else
	This talking lord can lay upon my credit,

	If I lov'd many words, lord, I should tell you,
	You have as little honesty as honour,
	That in the way of loyalty and truth
	Toward the king, my ever royal master,
	Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,

<SPEECH 70><ACT 3><SCENE 2><64%>
<WOLSEY>	<64%>
	So farewell to the little good you bear me.
	Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
	This is the state of man: to-day be puts forth
	The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
	And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;
	And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
	And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
	Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
	This many summers in a sea of glory,
	But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
	At length broke under me, and now has left me,
	Weary and old with service, to the mercy
	Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
	Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate yo:
	I feel my heart new open'd. O! how wretched
	Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
	There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
	That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
	More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
	And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
	Never to hope again.

	Why, well;
	Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
	I know myself now; and I feel within me
	A peace above all earthly dignities,
	A still and quiet conscience. The king has cur'd me,
	I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,
	These ruin'd pillars, out of pity taken
	A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
	O! 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden
	Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 73><ACT 3><SCENE 2><65%>
<WOLSEY>	<65%>
	I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,—

	May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on 'em!
	What more?

	There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell!
	The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
	In that one woman I have lost for ever.
	No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
	Or gild again the noble troops that waited
	Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
	I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
	To be thy lord and master: seek the king;—
	That sun, I pray, may never set!—I have told him
	What, and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
	Some little memory of me will stir him—
	I know his noble nature—not to let
	Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,
	Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
	For thine own future safety.

	Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
	In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me,
	Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
	Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
	And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
	And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
	Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
	Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
	And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
	Found thee a way, out of his wrack, to rise in;
	A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
	Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
	Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
	By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,
	The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?
	Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
	Corruption wins not more than honesty.
	Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
	To silence envious tongues: be just, and fear not.
	Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
	Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell!
	Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the king;
	And,—prithee, lead me in:
	There take an inventory of all I have,
	To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
	And my integrity to heaven is all
	I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
	Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal
	I serv'd my king, he would not in mine age
	Have left me naked to mine enemies.
</WOLSEY>

<SPEECH 79><ACT 3><SCENE 2><67%>
<WOLSEY>	<68%>
	So I have. Farewell
	The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
