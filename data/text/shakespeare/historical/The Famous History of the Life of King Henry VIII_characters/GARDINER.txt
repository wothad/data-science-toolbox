<Aside to Wolsey.>
</STAGE DIR> But to be commanded
	For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.

	It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<GARDINER>	<80%>
	These should be hours for necessities,
	Not for delights; times to repair our nature
	With comforting repose, and not for us
	To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
	Whither so late?
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<GARDINER>	<80%>
	I did, Sir Thomas; and left him at primero
	With the Duke of Suffolk.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 1><79%>
<GARDINER>	<80%>
	Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What 's the matter?
	It seems you are in haste: an if there be
	No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
	Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk—
	As they say spirits do—at midnight, have
	In them a wilder nature than the business
	That seeks dispatch by day.

	The fruit she goes with
	I pray for heartily, that it may find
	Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
	I wish it grubb'd up now.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<GARDINER>	<80%>
	But, sir, sir,
	Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman
	Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;
	And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,
	'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take 't of me,
	Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,
	Sleep in their graves.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 1><80%>
<GARDINER>	<81%>
	Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,
	There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd
	To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,
	Sir,—I may tell it you,—I think I have
	Incens'd the lords o' the council that he is—
	For so I know he is, they know he is—
	A most arch heretic, a pestilence
	That does infect the land: with which they mov'd
	Have broken with the king; who hath so far
	Given ear to our complaint,—of his great grace
	And princely care, foreseeing those fell mischiefs
	Our reasons laid before him,—hath commanded
	To-morrow morning to the council-board
	He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,
	And we must root him out. From your affairs
	I hinder you too long: good-night, Sir Thomas!
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<GARDINER>	<88%>
	Has he had knowledge of it?
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<GARDINER>	<88%>
	Yes.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<GARDINER>	<88%>
	Which reformation must be sudden too,
	My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
	Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
	But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,
	Till they obey the manage. If we suffer—
	Out of our easiness and childish pity
	To one man's honour—this contagious sickness,
	Farewell all physic: and what follows then?
	Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
	Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,
	The upper Germany, can dearly witness,
	Yet freshly pitied in our memories.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<GARDINER>	<89%>
	My lord, because we have business of more moment,
	We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,
	And our consent, for better trial of you,
	From hence you be committed to the Tower;
	Where, being but a private man again,
	You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
	More than, I fear, you are provided for.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	My lord, my lord, you are a sectary;
	That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,
	To men that understand you, words and weakness.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	Good Master secretary,
	I cry your honour mercy, you may, worst
	Of all this table, say so.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	Do not I know you for a favourer
	Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	Not sound, I say.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	I shall remember this bold language.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<90%>
	I have done.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<91%>
	What other
	Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.
	Let some o' the guard be ready there.

</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<GARDINER>	<91%>
	Receive him,
	And see him safe i' the Tower.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<GARDINER>	<91%>
	Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven
	In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;
	Not only good and wise, but most religious:
	One that in all obedience makes the Church
	The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen
	That holy duty, out of dear respect,
	His royal self in judgment comes to hear
	The cause betwixt her and this great offender.
</GARDINER>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><93%>
<GARDINER>	<93%>
	With a true heart
	And brother-love I do it.
</GARDINER>
