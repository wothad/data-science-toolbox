<PLANTAGENET>	<32%>
	Great lords, and gentlemen, what means this silence?
	Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><31%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<32%>
	Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth,
	Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<32%>
	Tut, tut! here is a mannerly forbearance:
	The truth appears so naked on my side,
	That any purblind eye may find it out.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><32%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<33%>
	Since you are tongue-tied, and so loath to speak,
	In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
	Let him that is a true-born gentleman,
	And stands upon the honour of his birth,
	If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
	From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<33%>
	And I.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 2><SCENE 4><33%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Meantime, your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
	For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
	The truth on our side.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
	Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
	I scorn thee and thy faction, peevish boy.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<34%>
	Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 4><34%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<35%>
	He bears him on the place's privilege,
	Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<35%>
	My father was attached, not attained;
	Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
	And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
	Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
	I'll note you in my book of memory,
	To scourge you for this apprehension:
	Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<35%>
	And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
	As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
	Will I for ever and my faction wear,
	Until it wither with me to my grave
	Or flourish to the height of my degree.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 4><35%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<36%>
	How I am brav'd and must perforce endure it!
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<36%>
	Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
	That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 2><SCENE 4><36%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<36%>
	Thanks, gentle sir.
	Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say
	This quarrel will drink blood another day.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 2><SCENE 5><37%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<38%>
	Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd,
	Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 5><38%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<38%>
	First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
	And in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
	This day, in argument upon a case,
	Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
	Among which terms he us'd a lavish tongue
	And did upbraid me with my father's death:
	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
	Else with the like I had requited him.
	Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
	In honour of a true Plantagenet,
	And for alliance sake, declare the cause
	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 2><SCENE 5><38%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<38%>
	Discover more at large what cause that was,
	For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 2><SCENE 5><39%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<39%>
	Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 2><SCENE 5><39%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<40%>
	Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
	But yet methinks my father's execution
	Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 5><40%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<40%>
	O uncle! would some part of my young years
	Might but redeem the passage of your age.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 5><40%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<40%>
	And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
	In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,
	And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
	Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;
	And what I do imagine let that rest.
	Keepers, convey him hence; and I myself
	Will see his burial better than his life.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exeunt Keepers, bearing out the body of Mortimer.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
	Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort:
	And, for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
	Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house,
	I doubt not but with honour to redress;
	And therefore haste I to the parliament,
	Either to be restored to my blood,
	Or make my ill the advantage of my good.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit.>
</STAGE DIR>

</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<43%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
	Lest it be said, 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
	Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
	Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<47%>
	Thy humble servant vows obedience,
	And humble service till the point of death.
</PLANTAGENET>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<PLANTAGENET>	<47%>
	And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
	And as my duty springs, so perish they
	That grudge one thought against your majesty!
</PLANTAGENET>
