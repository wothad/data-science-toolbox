	Traitors have never other company.
	But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?

<BURGUNDY>	<24%>
	Pray God she prove not masculine ere long;
	If underneath the standard of the French
	She carry armour, as she hath begun.
</BURGUNDY>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 1><24%>
<BURGUNDY>	<24%>
	And I to this.

<BURGUNDY>	<27%>
	Myself—as far as I could well discern
	For smoke and dusky vapours of the night—
	Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull,
	When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
	Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
	That could not live asunder day or night.
	After that things are set in order here,
	We'll follow them with all the power we have.

<BURGUNDY>	<28%>
	Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
	Will turn into a peaceful comic sport,
	When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
	You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.

	Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
	I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,

	Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
	Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
	Thy noble deeds as valour's monument.

	What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.

	What sayst thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>

<BURGUNDY>	<57%>
	I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
	Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
	And made me almost yield upon my knees.
	Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen!
	And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:
	My forces and my power of men are yours.
	So, farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.
</BURGUNDY>

	Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
	See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
	Of the most bloody nurser of his harms.

	I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:
	Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.
