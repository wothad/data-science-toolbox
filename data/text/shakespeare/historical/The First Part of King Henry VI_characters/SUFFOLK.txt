	Faith, I have been a truant in the law,

	Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
<STAGE DIR>
<Gazes on her.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O fairest beauty! do not fear nor fly,

	I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
	And lay them gently on thy tender side.
	What art thou? say, that I may honour thee.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><84%>
<SUFFOLK>	<85%>
	An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.
	Be not offended, nature's miracle,
	Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:
	So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
	Keeping them prisoners underneath her wings.
	Yet if this servile usage once offend,
	Go and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.
<STAGE DIR>
<She turns away as going.>
</STAGE DIR>
	O stay! I have no power to let her pass;
	My hand would free her, but my heart says no.
	As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
	Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
	So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
	Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
	I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind.
	Fie, De la Pole! disable not thyself;
	Hast not a tongue? is she not here thy prisoner?
	Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
	Ay; beauty's princely majesty is such
	Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.

<SUFFOLK>	<86%>

<SUFFOLK>	<86%>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<SUFFOLK>	<86%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
	And peace established between these realms.
	But there remains a scruple in that too;

	Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
	And our nobility will scorn the match.

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>

<STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much:

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause—
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	Lady, wherefore talk you so?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
	Your bondage happy to be made a queen?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	And so shall you,
	If happy England's royal king be free.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<87%>
	I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
	To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
	And set a precious crown upon thy head,
	If thou wilt condescend to be my—
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	His love.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
	To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
	And have no portion in the choice myself.
	How say you, madam, are you so content?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	Then call our captains and our colours forth!
	And, madam, at your father's castle walls
	We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.
<STAGE DIR>
<Troops come forward.>
</STAGE DIR>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>

	See, Reignier, see thy daughter prisoner!
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	To me.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	Yes, there is remedy enough; my lord:
	Consent, and for thy honour, give consent,
	Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
	Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
	And this her easy-held imprisonment
	Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	Fair Margaret knows

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<SUFFOLK>	<88%>
	And here I will expect thy coming.

</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
	Fit to be made companion with a king.
	What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	That is her ransom; I deliver her;
	And those two counties I will undertake
	Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<SUFFOLK>	<89%>
	Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
	Because this is in traffic of a king:
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And yet, methinks, I could be well content
	To be mine own attorney in this case.
	I'll over then, to England with this news,
	And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.
	So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe,
	In golden palaces, as it becomes.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<SUFFOLK>	<90%>
	Farewell, sweet madam! but hark you, Margaret;
	No princely commendations to my king?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<SUFFOLK>	<90%>
	Words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed.
	But madam, I must trouble you again,
	No loving token to his majesty?
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<SUFFOLK>	<90%>
	And this withal.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<SUFFOLK>	<90%>
	O! wert thou for myself! But Suffolk, stay;
	Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;
	There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
	Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
	Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
	And natural graces that extinguish art;
	Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
	That, when thou com'st to kneel at Henry's feet,
	Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 5><96%>
<SUFFOLK>	<97%>
	Tush! my good lord, this superficial tale
	Is but a preface of her worthy praise:
	The chief perfections of that lovely dame—
	Had I sufficient skill to utter them—
	Would make a volume of enticing lines,
	Able to ravish any dull conceit:
	And, which is more, she is not so divine,
	So full replete with choice of all delights,
	But with as humble lowliness of mind
	She is content to be at your command;
	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
	To love and honour Henry as her lord.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SUFFOLK>	<97%>
	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
	Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
	To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
	By reason of his adversary's odds.
	A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
	And therefore may be broke without offence.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 5><SCENE 5><97%>
<SUFFOLK>	<98%>
	Yes, my good lord, her father is a king,
	The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
	And of such great authority in France
	As his alliance will confirm our peace,
	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 5><SCENE 5><98%>
<SUFFOLK>	<98%>
	A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
	That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
	To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
	Henry is able to enrich his queen,
	And not to seek a queen to make him rich:
	So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
	As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
	Marriage is a matter of more worth
	Than to be dealt in by attorneyship:
	Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
	Must be companion of his nuptial bed;
	And therefore, lords, since he affects her most
	It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
	In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
	For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,
	An age of discord and continual strife?
	Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
	And is a pattern of celestial peace.
	Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
	But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
	Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
	Approves her fit for none but for a king:
	Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit—
	More than in women commonly is seen—
	Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
	For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
	Is likely to beget more conquerors,
	If with a lady of so high resolve
	As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
	Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
	That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
</SUFFOLK>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 5><SCENE 5><99%>
<SUFFOLK>	<100%>
	Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
	As did the youthful Paris once to Greece;
	With hope to find the like event in love,
	But prosper better than the Trojan did.
	Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;
	But I will rule both her, the king, and realm.
</SUFFOLK>
