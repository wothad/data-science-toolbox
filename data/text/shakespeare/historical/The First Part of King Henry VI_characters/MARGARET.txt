<MARGARET>	<85%>
	Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
	The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 5><SCENE 3><85%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	Say, Earl of Suffolk,—if thy name be so,—
	What ransom must I pay before I pass?
	For I perceive, I am thy prisoner.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 5><SCENE 3><85%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 5><SCENE 3><85%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 5><SCENE 3><85%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
	And yet I would that you would answer me.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<86%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Overhearing him.>
</STAGE DIR> He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
	Hear ye, captain? Are you not at leisure?
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,
	And will not any way dishonour me.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 3><86%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French;
	And then I need not crave his courtesy.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
	Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
	I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
	To be a queen in bondage is more vile
	Than is a slave in base servility;
	For princes should be free.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<87%>
	Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<88%>
	What?
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<88%>
	I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<MARGARET>	<88%>
	An if my father please, I am content.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<MARGARET>	<89%>
	Farewell, my lord. Good wishes, praise, and prayers
	Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<MARGARET>	<90%>
	Such commendations as become a maid,
	A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<MARGARET>	<90%>
	Yes, my good lord; a pure unspotted heart,
	Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
</MARGARET>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<MARGARET>	<90%>
	That for thyself: I will not so presume,
	To send such peevish tokens to a king.
</MARGARET>
