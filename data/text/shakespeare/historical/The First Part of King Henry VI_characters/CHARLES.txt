	Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
	So in the earth, to this day is not known.
	Late did he shine upon the English side;
	Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
	What towns of any moment but we have?
	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
	Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
	Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
</CHARLES>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<CHARLES>	<7%>
	Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
	Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
	Him I forgive my death that killeth me
	When he sees me go back one foot or fly.

	Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
	Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 2><7%>
<CHARLES>	<8%>
	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
	And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.

	Go, call her in. <STAGE DIR>
<Exit Bastard.>
</STAGE DIR> But first, to try her skill,
	Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
	Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
	By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

	Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.
	Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
	In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,

	Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
</CHARLES>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 1><SCENE 2><10%>

	Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
	Impatiently I burn with thy desire;

	Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
	Let me thy servant and not sovereign be;
	'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.

	Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?

	How may I reverently worship thee enough?
</CHARLES>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 2><11%>
<CHARLES>	<12%>
	Presently we'll try. Come, let's away about it:

<CHARLES>	<22%>
	Divinest creature, Astræa's daughter,
	How shall I honour thee for this success?
	Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens,
	That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
	France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
	Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
	More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.

	'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
	For which I will divide my crown with her;
	And all the priests and friars in my realm
	Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
	A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
	Than Rhodope's or Memphis ever was:
	In memory of her when she is dead,
	Her ashes, in an urn more precious
	Than the rich-jewell'd coffer of Darius,
	Transported shall be at high festivals
	Before the kings and queens of France.
	No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
	But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
	Come in, and let us banquet royally,
	After this golden day of victory.

	Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
	Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,

<CHARLES>	<26%>
	Duke of Alençon, this was your default,

<SPEECH 19><ACT 2><SCENE 1><25%>
<CHARLES>	<26%>
	And for myself, most part of all this night,
	Within her quarter and mine own precinct
	I was employ'd in passing to and fro,

	Then how or which way should they first break in?
</CHARLES>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<CHARLES>	<54%>
	We have been guided by thee hitherto,

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<CHARLES>	<55%>
	Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
	France were no place for Henry's warriors;

	Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed,

<CHARLES>	<95%>
	'Tis known already that I am possess'd

	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
	Detract so much from that prerogative
	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
	No, lord ambassador; I'll rather keep
	That which I have than, coveting for more,
	Be cast from possibility of all.
