<AUMERLE>	<10%>
	Yea, at all points, and longs to enter in.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><9%>
<AUMERLE>	<10%>
	Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
	For nothing but his majesty's approach.

</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<AUMERLE>	<19%>
	Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
	From where you do remain let paper show.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
<AUMERLE>	<21%>
	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
	But to the next highway, and there I left him.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
<AUMERLE>	<21%>
	Faith, none for me; except the northeast wind,
	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
	Awak'd the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 4><21%>
<AUMERLE>	<22%>
	'Farewell:'
	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
	That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
	And added years to his short banishment,
	He should have had a volume of farewells;
	But, since it would not, he had none of me.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<AUMERLE>	<48%>
	Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air,
	After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<AUMERLE>	<49%>
	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
	Grows strong and great in substance and in friends.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<AUMERLE>	<51%>
	Comfort, my liege! why looks your Grace so pale?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<AUMERLE>	<51%>
	Comfort, my liege! remember who you are.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<AUMERLE>	<53%>
	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><52%>
<AUMERLE>	<53%>
	Where is the duke my father with his power?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<AUMERLE>	<55%>
	My father hath a power; inquire of him
	And learn to make a body of a limb.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><55%>
<AUMERLE>	<56%>
	My liege, one word.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<AUMERLE>	<60%>
	No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words,
	Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<AUMERLE>	<61%>
	Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 1><67%>
<AUMERLE>	<68%>
	Princes and noble lords,
	What answer shall I make to this base man?
	Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
	On equal terms to give him chastisement?
	Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
	With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
	There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
	That marks thee out for hell: I say thou liest,
	And will maintain what thou hast said is false
	In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
	To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	Excepting one, I would he were the best
	In all this presence that hath mov'd me so.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	And if I do not may my hands rot off
	And never brandish more revengeful steel
	Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 4><SCENE 1><68%>
<AUMERLE>	<69%>
	Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
	I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
	To answer twenty thousand such as you.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 1><69%>
<AUMERLE>	<70%>
	Some honest Christian trust me with a gage.
	That Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,
	If he may be repeal'd to try his honour.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 4><SCENE 1><78%>
<AUMERLE>	<79%>
	You holy clergymen, is there no plot
	To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
	God knows I had as lief be none as one.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	For aught I know, my lord, they do.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	If God prevent it not, I purpose so.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	My lord, 'tis nothing.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 2><84%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	I do beseech your Grace to pardon me:
	It is a matter of small consequence,
	Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<AUMERLE>	<85%>
	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 2><85%>
<AUMERLE>	<86%>
	Good mother, be content; it is no more
	Than my poor life must answer.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 3><87%>
<AUMERLE>	<88%>
	Where is the king?
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<AUMERLE>	<88%>
	God save your Grace! I do beseech your majesty,
	To have some conference with your Grace alone.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<AUMERLE>	<88%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Kneels.>
</STAGE DIR> For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
	My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,
	Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<AUMERLE>	<89%>
	Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
	That no man enter till my tale be done.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<AUMERLE>	<89%>
	Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<AUMERLE>	<89%>
	Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
	I do repent me; read not my name there;
	My heart is not confederate with my hand.
</AUMERLE>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 5><SCENE 3><91%>
<AUMERLE>	<91%>
	Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
