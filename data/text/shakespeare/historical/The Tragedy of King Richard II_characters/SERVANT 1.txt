	Why should we in the compass of a pale
	Keep law and form and due proportion,
	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
	When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
	Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok'd up,
	Her fruit-trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,
	Her knots disorder'd, and her wholesome herbs
	Swarming with caterpillars?
