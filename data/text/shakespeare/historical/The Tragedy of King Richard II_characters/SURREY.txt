	My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
	The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

	Dishonourable boy!
	That he shall lie so heavy on my sword
	That it shall render vengeance and revenge,
	Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
	In earth as quiet as thy father's skull.
	In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn:
	Engage it to the trial if thou dar'st.
