	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 1><1%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<1%>
	First,—heaven be the record to my speech!—
	In the devotion of a subject's love,
	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
	And free from other misbegotten hate,
	Come I appellant to this princely presence.
	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
	My body shall make good upon this earth,
	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant;
	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
	What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 1><2%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<3%>
	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king;
	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except:
	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
	By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,
	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><3%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<3%>
	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
	That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
	The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
	Besides I say and will in battle prove,
	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
	That ever was survey'd by English eye,
	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
	Complotted and contrived in this land,
	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
	Further I say and further will maintain
	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
	Suggest his soon believing adversaries,
	And consequently, like a traitor coward,
	Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
	To me for justice and rough chastisement;
	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 1><6%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<7%>
	O! God defend my soul from such deep sin.
	Shall I seem crest fall'n in my father's sight,
	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
	Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my tongue
	Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong,
	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
	The slavish motive of recanting fear,
	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
</BOLINGBROKE>

	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
	Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
	To prove by God's grace and my body's valour,
	In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
	That he's a traitor foul and dangerous,
	To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me:
	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><11%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<12%>
	Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,

	And loving farewell of our several friends.

	O! let no noble eye profane a tear

	As confident as is the falcon's flight
	Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
	My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
	Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
	Not sick, although I have to do with death,
	But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
	Lo! as at English feasts, so I regreet
	The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
	O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
	Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
	Doth with a two-fold vigour lift me up
	To reach at victory above my head,
	Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,
	And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
	That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
	And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
	Even in the lusty haviour of his son.

	My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
	On what condition stands it and wherein?
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 2><SCENE 3><43%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<43%>
	As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
	And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
	You are my father, for methinks in you
	I see old Gaunt alive: O! then, my father,
	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
	If that my cousin king be King of England,
	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble kinsman;
	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
	I am denied to sue my livery here,
	And yet my letters-patent give me leave:
	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
	And challenge law: attorneys are denied me,
	And therefore personally I lay my claim
	To my inheritance of free descent.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 2><SCENE 3><44%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<45%>
	An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
	But we must win your Grace to go with us
	To Bristol Castle; which they say is held
	By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,
	The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
	Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 1><46%>

	Bring forth these men.
	Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls—
	Since presently your souls must part your bodies—
	With too much urging your pernicious lives,
	For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
	From off my hands, here in the view of men
	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
	You have misled a prince, a royal king,
	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
	By you unhappied and disfigur'd clean:
	You have in manner with your sinful hours
	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
	Broke the possession of a royal bed,
	And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
	Near to the king in blood, and near in love
	Till you did make him misinterpret me,
	Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
	And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
	Dispark'd my parks, and felled my forest woods,
	From mine own windows torn my household coat,
	Raz'd out my impress, leaving me no sign,
	Save men's opinions and my living blood,
	To show the world I am a gentleman.
	This and much more, much more than twice all this,
	Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
	To execution and the hand of death.
</BOLINGBROKE>

<To North.>
</STAGE DIR> Noble lord,
	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle,
	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
	Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
	Henry Bolingbroke
	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
	To his most royal person; hither come
	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
	Provided that my banishment repeal'd,
	And lands restor'd again be freely granted.
	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power,
	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
	Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
	Go, signify as much, while here we march
	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
	Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
	That from the castle's totter'd battlements
	Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
	With no less terror than the elements
	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
	The rage be his, while on the earth I rain
	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.

	Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
	And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.'
	My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
	I know she's come to pray for your foul sin.

	But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
	With all the rest of that consorted crew,
	Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
	Good uncle, help to order several powers
	To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
	They shall not live within this world, I swear,
	But I will have them, if I once know where.
	Uncle, farewell: and cousin too, adieu:
	Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.

	Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
	Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire
	Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
	But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.

	We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,

	Carlisle, this is your doom:
	Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
	More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
	So, as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
	For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
	High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.

</BOLINGBROKE>

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 6><99%>
<BOLINGBROKE>	<99%>
	Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
	A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
	Upon my head and all this famous land.

	They love not poison that do poison need,
	Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
	I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
	The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
	But neither my good word nor princely favour:
	With Cain go wander through the shade of night,
	And never show thy head by day nor light.
	Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
	That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
	Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
	And put on sullen black incontinent.
	I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
	To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
	March sadly after; grace my mournings here,
	In weeping after this untimely bier.
