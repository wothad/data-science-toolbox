	Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father; and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.

	Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,

	My Lord of Gloucester, now you grow too hot:
	It was the pleasure of my lord the king.
</CARDINAL>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 1><4%>
<CARDINAL>	<5%>
	So, there goes our protector in a rage.
	'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
	Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
	And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
	Consider lords, he is the next of blood,
	And heir apparent to the English crown:
	Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
	And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
	There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.
	Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words
	Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
	What though the common people favour him,
	Calling him, 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester;'
	Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
	'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
	With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
	I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
	He will be found a dangerous protector.
</CARDINAL>

	This weighty business will not brook delay;

	Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><22%>

	It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.

	My liege, his railing is intolerable.
	If those that care to keep your royal person
	From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage
	Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,

	'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.

	That he should die is worthy policy;

	But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,

	My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
	The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
	And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:
	To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
	Collected choicely, from each county some,
	And try your hap against the Irishmen?
</CARDINAL>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><47%>
<CARDINAL>	<47%>
	No more of him; for I will deal with him
	That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
	And so break off; the day is almost spent.
	Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.
</CARDINAL>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>

	God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night

	If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,

	Bring me unto my trial when you will.
	Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
	Can I make men live whe'r they will or no?
	O! torture me no more, I will confess.
	Alive again? then show me where he is:
	I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
	He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
	Comb down his hair; look! look! it stands upright,
	Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
	Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary
	Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
</CARDINAL>
