	Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
	And greatness of his place be grief to us,
	Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
	His insolence is more intolerable
	Than all the princes in the land beside:
	If Gloucester be displac'd, he'll be protector.

	Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown.
	Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.
