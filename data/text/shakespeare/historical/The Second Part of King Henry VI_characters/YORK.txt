	France should have torn and rent my very heart

	I never read but England's kings have had
	Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;

	Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
	Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
	Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.
	Suffolk concluded on the articles,
	The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleas'd
	To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
	I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
	'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
	Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,
	And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
	Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
	While as the silly owner of the goods
	Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,
	And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,
	While all is shar'd and all is borne away,
	Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
	So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
	While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
	Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland
	Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
	As did the fatal brand Althæa burn'd
	Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
	Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
	Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
	A day will come when York shall claim his own;
	And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
	And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
	And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
	For that's the golden mark I seek to hit.
	Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right.
	Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
	Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
	Whose church-like humours fit not for a crown.
	Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
	Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
	To pry into the secrets of the state;
	Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
	With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
	And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
	Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
	With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd,
	And in my standard bear the arms of York,
	To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
	And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
	Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

	I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:

	But him outlive, and die a violent death.
	Why, this is just,

	Well, to the rest:
	Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
	By water shall he die and take his end.
	What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
	Let him shun castles:
	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
	Than where castles mounted stand.
	Come, come, my lords; these oracles
	Are hardly attain'd, and hardly understood.
	The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's;
	With him, the husband of this lovely lady:
	Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them,
	A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.

	Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
	Our simple supper ended, give me leave,

</YORK>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 2><28%>
<YORK>	<29%>
	Then thus:
	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
	The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
	Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom
	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
	Edward the Black Prince died before his father,
	And left behind him Richard, his only son,
	Who after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king;
	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
	Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
	Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,
	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
	And him to Pomfret; where as all you know,
	Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<YORK>	<29%>
	Which now they hold by force and not by right;
	For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
	The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<YORK>	<29%>
	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
	I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe a daughter,
	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
	Edmund had issue Roger, Earl of March:
	Roger had issue Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><29%>
<YORK>	<30%>
	His eldest sister, Anne,
	My mother, being heir unto the crown,
	Married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was son
	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
	By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
	To Roger, Earl of March; who was the son
	Of Edmund Mortimer; who married Philippe,
	Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence:
	So, if the issue of the eldest son
	Succeed before the younger, I am king.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 2><SCENE 2><30%>
<YORK>	<30%>
	We thank you, lords! But I am not your king
	Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd
	With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
	And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
	But with advice and silent secrecy.
	Do you as I do in these dangerous days,
	Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
	At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
	At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
	Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
	That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
	'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that
	Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.

	My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days

</YORK>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 1><48%>
<YORK>	<48%>
	Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
	And change misdoubt to resolution:
	Be that thou hop'st to be, or what thou art
	Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying.
	Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man,
	And find no harbour in a royal heart.
	Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought,
	And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
	My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,
	Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
	Well, nobles, well; 'tis politicly done,
	To send me packing with a host of men:
	I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
	Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
	'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me:
	I take it kindly; yet be well assur'd
	You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
	Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
	I will stir up in England some black storm
	Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
	And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
	Until the golden circuit on my head,
	Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
	Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
	And, for a minister of my intent,
	I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,
	John Cade of Ashford,
	To make commotion, as full well he can,
	Under the title of John Mortimer.
	In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
	Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
	And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
	Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine:
	And, in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
	Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
	Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
	Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
	Hath he conversed with the enemy,
	And undiscover'd come to me again,
	And given me notice of their villanies.
	This devil here shall be my substitute;
	For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
	In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble;
	By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
	How they affect the house and claim of York.
	Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured,
	I know no pain they can inflict upon him
	Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.
	Say that he thrive,as 'tis great like he will,
	Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength,
	And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
	For, Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
	And Henry put apart, the next for me.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 5><SCENE 1><88%>
<YORK>	<89%>
	From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
	And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
	Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
	To entertain great England's lawful king.
	Ah sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
	Let them obey that know not how to rule;
	This hand was made to handle nought but gold:
	I cannot give due action to my words,
	Except a sword, or sceptre balance it.
	A sceptre shall it have, have I-a soul,
	On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
