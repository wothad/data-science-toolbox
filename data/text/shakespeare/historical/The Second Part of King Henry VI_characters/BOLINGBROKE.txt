	Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
	Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
	The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
	The time when screech-owls cry, and ban-dogs howl,
	And spirits walk, and ghosts break up their graves,
	That time best fits the work we have in hand.
	Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
	We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
