	Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
	Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;
	Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:
	The king is merciful, if you revolt.

	Villain! thy father was a plasterer;

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>
<STAFFORD>	<72%>
	And what of that?
</STAFFORD>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 2><72%>

	Herald, away; and throughout every town
	Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
	That those which fly before the battle ends
	May, even in their wives' and children's sight,
	Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
	And you, that be the king's friends, follow me.
