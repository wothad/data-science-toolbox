	Well, for this night we will repose us here:

	You four, from hence to prison back again;
	From thence, unto the place of execution:
	The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
	And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
	You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
	Despoiled of your honour in your life,
	Shall, after three days' open penance done,
	Live in your country here, in banishment,
	With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.

<K. HENRY>	<40%>
	My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
	To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
	Is worthy praise; but shall I speak my conscience,
	Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
	From meaning treason to our royal person,
	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
	The duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
	To dream on evil, or to work my downfall.

<K. HENRY>	<44%>
	Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
	Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
	My body round engirt with misery,
	For what's more miserable than discontent?
	Ah! uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
	The map of honour, truth, and loyalty;
	And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
	That e'er I prov'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
	What low'ring star now envies thy estate,
	That these great lords, and Margaret our queen,
	Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
	Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
	And as the butcher takes away the calf,
	And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
	Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
	Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;
	And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
	Looking the way her harmless young one went,
	And can do nought but wail her darling's loss;
	Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case,
	With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
	Look after him, and cannot do him good;
	So mighty are his vowed enemies.
	His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan,
	Say 'Who's a traitor, Gloucester he is none.'
</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<K. HENRY>	<50%>
	Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;
	Say, we intend to try his Grace to-day,

<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<K. HENRY>	<50%>
	Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,

	He be approv'd in practice culpable.

<K. HENRY>	<51%>
	What! doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
	Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
	Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,
	And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
	By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
	Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
	Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words:
	Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say:
	Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
	Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
	Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
	Sits in grim majesty to fright the world.
	Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:
	Yet do not go away; come, basilisk,
	And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
	For in the shade of death I shall find joy,
	In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.

	That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 2><53%>
<K. HENRY>	<54%>
	O! Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
	My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
	Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life.
	If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
	For judgment only doth belong to thee.
	Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
	With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
	Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
	To tell my love unto his deaf dumb trunk,
	And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
	But all in vain are these mean obsequies,
	And to survey his dead and earthly image
	What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

</K. HENRY>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 2><54%>
<K. HENRY>	<54%>
	That is to see how deep my grave is made;

	Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,

	Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
	And therefore, by his majesty I swear,
	Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
	He shall not breathe infection in this air
	But three days longer, on the pain of death.

	Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
