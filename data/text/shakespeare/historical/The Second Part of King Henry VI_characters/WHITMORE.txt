	I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
<STAGE DIR>
<To Suffolk.>
</STAGE DIR> And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die;
	And so should these if I might have my will.

	Gaultier, or Walter, which it is I care not;
	Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
	But with our sword we wip'd away the blot:
	Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
	Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd,
	And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!

	Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
	What! are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?

<WHITMORE>	<68%>
	There let his head and lifeless body lie,
	Until the queen his mistress bury it.
