</STAGE DIR> I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>

<STAGE DIR>
<Aside to Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR> I think he means to beg a child of her.

<STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> As red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt.

<STAGE DIR>

</STAGE DIR> He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.

</STAGE DIR> When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shift.

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CLARENCE>	<51%>
	To whom, my lord?
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><51%>
<CLARENCE>	<51%>
	That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
<CLARENCE>	<63%>
	Alas! you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
	How could he stay till Warwick made return?
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
<CLARENCE>	<63%>
	I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 4><SCENE 1><62%>
<CLARENCE>	<63%>
	As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick;
	Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
	That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 4><SCENE 1><63%>
<CLARENCE>	<64%>
	Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
	Becomes your enemy for mocking him
	About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<CLARENCE>	<64%>
	For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
	To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<CLARENCE>	<64%>
	Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
	Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
	And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<CLARENCE>	<65%>
	In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
	Which being shallow, you shall give me leave
	To play the broker on mine own behalf;
	And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 4><SCENE 1><66%>
<CLARENCE>	<66%>
	Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
	Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
	For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
	That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
	I may not prove inferior to yourself.
	You, that love me and Warwick, follow me.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 4><SCENE 2><67%>
<CLARENCE>	<68%>
	Fear not that, my lord.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
<CLARENCE>	<74%>
	No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
	To whom the heavens, in thy nativity
	Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown,
	As likely to be blest in peace, and war;
	And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 4><SCENE 6><74%>
<CLARENCE>	<75%>
	That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
	For on thy fortune I repose myself.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
<CLARENCE>	<75%>
	What else? and that succession be determin'd.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 4><SCENE 6><75%>
<CLARENCE>	<75%>
	It shall be done, my sov'reign, with all speed.
</CLARENCE>

	A little fire is quickly trodden out,
	Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

<SPEECH 23><ACT 4><SCENE 8><80%>
<CLARENCE>	<81%>
	In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 5><SCENE 1><85%>
<CLARENCE>	<85%>
	Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
<STAGE DIR>
<Taking the red rose out of his hat.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Look here, I throw my infamy at thee:
	I will not ruinate my father's house,
	Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
	And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
	That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
	To bend the fatal instruments of war
	Against his brother and his lawful king?
	Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
	To keep that oath were more impiety
	Than Jephthah's, when he sacrific'd his daughter.
	I am so sorry for my trespass made
	That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
	I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;
	With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee—
	As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad—
	To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
	And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
	And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
	Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends;
	And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
	For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<CLARENCE>	<89%>
	A little gale will soon disperse that cloud,
	And blow it to the source from whence it came:
	Thy very beams will dry those vapours up,
	For every cloud engenders not a storm.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<CLARENCE>	<93%>
	Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<CLARENCE>	<94%>
	And there's for twitting me with perjury.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 5><SCENE 5><93%>
<CLARENCE>	<94%>
	What? what?
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
<CLARENCE>	<95%>
	By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 5><SCENE 5><94%>
<CLARENCE>	<95%>
	Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 5><SCENE 5><95%>
<CLARENCE>	<95%>
	To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
	To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
<CLARENCE>	<99%>
	The duty, that I owe unto your majesty,
	I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
</CLARENCE>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 5><SCENE 7><99%>
<CLARENCE>	<100%>
	What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
	Reignier, her father, to the King of France
	Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
	And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
</CLARENCE>
