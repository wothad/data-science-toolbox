<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 3><53%>
<K. LEWIS>	<54%>
	Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
	Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
	And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<K. LEWIS>	<54%>
	Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<K. LEWIS>	<54%>
	Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
	And sit thee by our side. <STAGE DIR>
<Seats her by him.>
</STAGE DIR> Yield not thy neck
	To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
	Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
	Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
	It shall be eas'd, if France can yield relief.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<K. LEWIS>	<55%>
	Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
	While we bethink a means to break it off.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 3><54%>
<K. LEWIS>	<55%>
	The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<K. LEWIS>	<55%>
	What's he, approacheth boldly to our presence?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 3><55%>
<K. LEWIS>	<55%>
	Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<K. LEWIS>	<57%>
	Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
	Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside,
	While I use further conference with Warwick.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<K. LEWIS>	<58%>
	Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
	Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
	To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<K. LEWIS>	<58%>
	But is he gracious in the people's eye?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<K. LEWIS>	<58%>
	Then further, all dissembling set aside,
	Tell me for truth the measure of his love
	Unto our sister Bona.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 3><57%>
<K. LEWIS>	<58%>
	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<K. LEWIS>	<58%>
	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
	And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
	Touching the jointure that your king must make,
	Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd.
	Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
	That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<K. LEWIS>	<59%>
	And still is friend to him and Margaret:
	But if your title to the crown be weak,
	As may appear by Edward's good success,
	Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd
	From giving aid which late I promised.
	Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
	That your estate requires and mine can yield.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 3><58%>
<K. LEWIS>	<59%>
	Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<K. LEWIS>	<59%>
	Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<K. LEWIS>	<60%>
	What! has your king married the Lady Grey?
	And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
	Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
	Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
	Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<K. LEWIS>	<61%>
	And mine with hers, and thine and Margaret's.
	Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv'd
	You shall have aid.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 3><60%>
<K. LEWIS>	<61%>
	Then, England's messenger, return in post,
	And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers,
	To revel it with him and his new bride.
	Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
<K. LEWIS>	<61%>
	But, Warwick,
	Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
	Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
	And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
	And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
	Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:
	What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
</K. LEWIS>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 3><61%>
<K. LEWIS>	<62%>
	Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
	And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
	Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.
	I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
	For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
</K. LEWIS>
