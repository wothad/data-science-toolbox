	Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
	Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
	And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
	Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
	And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
	Who by his prowess conquered all France:
	From these our Henry lineally descends.

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OXFORD>	<57%>
	Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
	Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years,
	And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 3><56%>
<OXFORD>	<57%>
	Call him my king, by whose injurious doom
	My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
	Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
	Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
	When nature brought him to the door of death?
	No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
	This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 3><59%>
<OXFORD>	<59%>
	I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
	Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 4><SCENE 3><70%>
<OXFORD>	<71%>
	What now remains, my lords, for us to do,
	But march to London with our soldiers?
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 4><SCENE 6><76%>
<OXFORD>	<77%>
	Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
	'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 4><SCENE 8><80%>
<OXFORD>	<80%>
	Let's levy men, and beat him back again.

	Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 5><SCENE 2><88%>
<OXFORD>	<88%>
	Away, away, to meet the queen's great power.
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 5><SCENE 4><90%>
<OXFORD>	<91%>
	Women and children of so high a courage,
	And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
	O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
	Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
	To bear his image and renew his glories!
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
<OXFORD>	<91%>
	I thought no less: it is his policy
	To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
</OXFORD>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 5><SCENE 4><91%>
<OXFORD>	<91%>
	Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.

	For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
