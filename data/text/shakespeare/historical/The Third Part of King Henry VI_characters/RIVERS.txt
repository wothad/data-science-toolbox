	Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?

<SPEECH 2><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<RIVERS>	<71%>
	What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

	These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
	Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
	Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
</RIVERS>

<RIVERS>	<72%>
	But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
