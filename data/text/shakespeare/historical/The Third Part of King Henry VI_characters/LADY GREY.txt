<SPEECH 1><ACT 3><SCENE 2><46%>
<LADY GREY>	<47%>
	Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
	May it please your highness to resolve me now,
	And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	Three, my most gracious lord.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 3><SCENE 2><47%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	To do them good I would sustain some harm.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	Therefore I came unto your majesty.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<48%>
	So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	What you command, that rests in me to do.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	Why stops my lord? shall I not hear my task?
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 2><48%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers:
	That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<49%>
	My mind will never grant what I perceive
	Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<50%>
	To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<50%>
	Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
	For by that loss I will not purchase them.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<50%>
	Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
	But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
	Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
	Please you dismiss me, either with 'ay,' or 'no.'
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<LADY GREY>	<50%>
	Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<LADY GREY>	<50%>
	'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
	I am a subject fit to jest withal,
	But far unfit to be a sovereign.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<LADY GREY>	<51%>
	And that is more than I will yield unto.
	I know I am too mean to be your queen,
	And yet too good to be your concubine.
</LADY GREY>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 2><50%>
<LADY GREY>	<51%>
	'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
</LADY GREY>
