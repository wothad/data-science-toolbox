	Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
	Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,
	That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
	To cross me from the golden time I look for!
	And yet, between my soul's desire and me—
	The lustful Edward's title buried,—
	Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
	And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
	To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
	A cold premeditation for my purpose!
	Why then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
	Like one that stands upon a promontory,
	And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
	Wishing his foot were equal with his eye;
	And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
	Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
	So do I wish the crown, being so far off,
	And so I chide the means that keep me from it,
	And so I say I'll cut the causes off,
	Flattering me with impossibilities.
	My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
	Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
	Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
	What other pleasure can the world afford?
	I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
	And deck my body in gay ornaments,
	And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
	O miserable thought! and more unlikely
	Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.
	Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
	And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
	She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
	To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
	To make an envious mountain on my back,
	Where sits deformity to mock my body;
	To shape my legs of an unequal size;
	To disproportion me in every part,
	Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
	That carries no impression like the dam.
	And am I then a man to be belov'd?
	O monstrous fault! to harbour such a thought.
	Then, since this earth affords no joy to me
	But to command, to check, to o'erbear such
	As are of better person than myself,
	I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown;
	And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
	Until my mis-shap'd trunk that bears this head
	Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
	And yet I know not how to get the crown,
	For many lives stand between me and home:
	And I, like one lost in a thorny wood,
	That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
	Seeking a way and straying from the way;
	Not knowing how to find the open air,
	But toiling desperately to find it out,
	Torment myself to catch the English crown:
	And from that torment I will free myself,
	Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
	Why, I can smile, and murder while I smile,
	And cry, 'Content,' to that which grieves my heart,
	And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
	And frame my face to all occasions.
	I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
	I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
	I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
	Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
	And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
	I can add colours to the chameleon,
	Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
	And set the murd'rous Machiavel to school.
	Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
	Tut! were it further off, I'll pluck it down.

	Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you

	Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
	Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
	Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
	Thus stands the case. You know, our king, my brother,
	Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
	He hath good usage and great liberty,
	And often but attended with weak guard,
	Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
	I have advertis'd him by secret means,
	That if about this hour he make this way,
	Under the colour of his usual game,
	He shall here find his friends, with horse and men
	To set him free from his captivity.

</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<73%>
	Brother, the time and case requireth haste.
	Your horse stands ready at the park corner.
</GLOUCESTER>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 4><SCENE 5><72%>
<GLOUCESTER>	<73%>
	Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.

<SPEECH 29><ACT 4><SCENE 5><73%>

	What! will the aspiring blood of Lancaster

	O! may such purple tears be always shed

	If any spark of life be yet remaining,
	Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither,
<STAGE DIR>
<Stabs him again.>
</STAGE DIR>
	I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
	Indeed, 'tis true, that Henry told me of;
	For I have often heard my mother say
	I came into the world with my legs forward.
	Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
	And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
	The midwife wonder'd, and the women cried
	'O! Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth.'
	And so I was; which plainly signified
	That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
	Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so,
	Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
	I have no brother, I am like no brother;
	And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
	Be resident in men like one another
	And not in me: I am myself alone.
	Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
	But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
	For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
	That Edward shall be fearful of his life;
	And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
	King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
	Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
	Counting myself but bad till I be best.
	I'll throw thy body in another room,
