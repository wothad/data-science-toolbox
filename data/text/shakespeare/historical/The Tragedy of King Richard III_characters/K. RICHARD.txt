	Give me thy hand. <STAGE DIR>
<He ascends the throne.>
</STAGE DIR> Thus high, by thy advice,

<SPEECH 3><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<K. RICHARD>	<66%>
	Ah! Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
	To try if thou be current gold indeed:

</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<K. RICHARD>	<66%>
	Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king.

<K. RICHARD>	<66%>
	O bitter consequence,

	What sayst thou now? speak suddenly, be brief.

	The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
	Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
	That Anne my queen is sick, and like to die:
	About it; for it stands me much upon,

	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd your Grace

	Madam, with all my heart.
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>

</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<K. RICHARD>	<79%>
	Say, that I did all this for love of her?
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 4><79%>
<K. RICHARD>	<79%>
	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
	Which after-hours give leisure to repent.
	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
	To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
	To quicken your increase, I will beget
	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter:
	A grandam's name is little less in love
	Than is the doting title of a mother;
	They are as children but one step below,
	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
	Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
	Endur'd of her for whom you bid like sorrow.
	Your children were vexation to your youth,
	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
	The loss you have is but a son being king,
	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
	I cannot make you what amends I would,
	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
	To high promotions and great dignity:
	The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
	Again shall you be mother to a king,
	And all the ruins of distressful times
	Repair'd with double riches of content.
	What! we have many goodly days to see:
	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
	Advantaging their loan with interest
	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
	Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go:
	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:
	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
	And she shall be sole victress, Cæsar's Cæsar.
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>

	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

<SPEECH 67><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>

	Tell her, the king, that may command, entreats.

<SPEECH 84><ACT 4><SCENE 4><82%>
<K. RICHARD>	<82%>
	As I intend to prosper, and repent,

	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
	Be opposite all planets of good luck
	To my proceeding, if, with pure heart's love,
	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
	In her consists my happiness and thine;
	Without her, follows to myself, and thee,
	Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
	Death, desolation, ruin, and decay:
	It cannot be avoided but by this;
	It will not be avoided but by this.
	Therefore, dear mother,—I must call you so,—
	Be the attorney of my love to her:
	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
	Urge the necessity and state of times,
	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

	Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:

	Go then and muster men: but leave behind

<SPEECH 107><ACT 4><SCENE 4><85%>
<K. RICHARD>	<85%>
	March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
	If not to fight with foreign enemies,

<SPEECH 108><ACT 4><SCENE 4><86%>
<K. RICHARD>	<86%>
	Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,

<K. RICHARD>	<88%>
	Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 112><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<K. RICHARD>	<88%>
	Up with my tent! here will I lie to-night;
<STAGE DIR>
<Soldiers begin to set up the King's tent.>

	But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
	Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 113><ACT 5><SCENE 3><88%>
<K. RICHARD>	<88%>
	Why, our battalia trebles that account;
	Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
	Which they upon the adverse faction want.
	Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
	Let us survey the vantage of the ground;
	Call for some men of sound direction:
	Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
	For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

<SPEECH 115><ACT 5><SCENE 3><89%>
<K. RICHARD>	<89%>
	I will not sup to-night.
	Give me some ink and paper.

<SPEECH 116><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<K. RICHARD>	<90%>
	Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;

<K. RICHARD>	<90%>
	Send out a pursuivant at arms

	Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
	Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
	Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
	Ratcliff!

<SPEECH 120><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>

	Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 121><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>
<K. RICHARD>	<90%>
	So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
	I have not that alacrity of spirit,

	Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

<SPEECH 122><ACT 5><SCENE 3><90%>

<K. RICHARD>	<94%>
	Give me another horse! bind up my wounds!
	Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
	What! do I fear myself? there's none else by:
	Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.
	Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
	Then fly: what! from myself? Great reason why:
	Lest I revenge. What! myself upon myself?
	Alack! I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
	That I myself have done unto myself?
	O! no: alas! I rather hate myself
	For hateful deeds committed by myself.
	I am a villain. Yet I lie; I am not.
	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
	And every tongue brings in a several tale,
	And every tale condemns me for a villain.
	Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree:
	Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
	All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
	Throng to the bar, crying all, 'Guilty! guilty!'
	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
	And if I die, no soul will pity me:
	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
	Find in myself no pity to myself?
	Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
	Came to my tent; and every one did threat
	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

<K. RICHARD>	<94%>
	O Ratcliff! I have dream'd a fearful dream.

	O Ratcliff! I fear, I fear,—
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 127><ACT 5><SCENE 3><94%>
<K. RICHARD>	<95%>
	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
	To hear if any mean to shrink from me.

	He was i' the right; and so, indeed, it is.

<SPEECH 131><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<K. RICHARD>	<96%>
	Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
	He should have brav'd the east an hour ago:
	A black day will it be to somebody.
	Ratcliff!
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 132><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<K. RICHARD>	<96%>
	The sun will not be seen to-day;
	The sky doth frown and lower upon our army.
	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
	More than to Richmond? for the self-same heaven
	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 133><ACT 5><SCENE 3><96%>
<K. RICHARD>	<97%>
	Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
	I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
	And thus my battle shall be ordered:
	My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
	Consisting equally of horse and foot;
	Our archers shall be placed in the midst:
	John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
	Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
	They thus directed, we will follow
	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
	This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
</K. RICHARD>

<SPEECH 134><ACT 5><SCENE 3><97%>
<K. RICHARD>	<97%>
	Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.
	A thing devised by the enemy.
	Go, gentlemen; every man to his charge:
	Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
	Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe:
	Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
	March on, join bravely, let us to 't pell-mell;
	If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
	His oration to his Army.
	What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
	Remember whom you are to cope withal:
	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and run-aways,
	A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,
	Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
	To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
	You sleeping safe, they bring you to unrest;
	You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
	They would restrain the one, distain the other.
	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
	Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
	A milksop, one that never in his life
	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
	Let's whip these stragglers o'er the sea again;
	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
	For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
	If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
	Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
	And, on record, left them the heirs of shame.
	Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
	Ravish our daughters?
<STAGE DIR>
<Drum afar off.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Hark! I hear their drum.
	Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yeomen!
	Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
