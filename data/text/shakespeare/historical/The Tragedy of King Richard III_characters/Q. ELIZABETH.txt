	Ah! he is young; and his minority

	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<14%>
	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<14%>
	By him that rais'd me to this careful height

	My lord, you do me shameful injury,

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 1><SCENE 3><14%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<14%>
	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs;
	By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
	Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
	I had rather be a country servantmaid
	Than a great queen, with this condition,
	To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at:
	Small joy have I in being England's queen.

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 1><SCENE 3><15%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<16%>
	As little joy, my lord, as you suppose

<SPEECH 23><ACT 2><SCENE 2><33%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<33%>
	To make an act of tragic violence:

	Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?

	If you will live, lament: if die, be brief,
	That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;

	To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 2><SCENE 2><34%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<34%>
	Give me no help in lamentation;

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<64%>
	Ah! cut my lace asunder,

<SPEECH 39><ACT 4><SCENE 1><64%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<64%>
	O, Dorset! speak not to me, get thee gone;
	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels:
	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell:
	Go, hie thee, hie thee, from this slaughter-house,
	Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

<Q. ELIZABETH>	<65%>
	Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory;

	Stay yet, look back with me unto the Tower.
	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
	Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
	Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
	For tender princes, use my babies well.
	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<71%>
	Ah! my poor princes! ah, my tender babes,

	If yet your gentle souls fly in the air

	Hover about me with your airy wings,
	And hear your mother's lamentation.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<71%>
	Wilt thou, O God! fly from such gentle lambs,

<SPEECH 46><ACT 4><SCENE 4><71%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<72%>
	Ah! that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<73%>
	O! thou didst prophesy the time would come

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 4><SCENE 4><73%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<74%>
	O thou, well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,

<SPEECH 49><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<74%>
	Windy attorneys to their client woes,

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 4><SCENE 4><74%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<75%>
	Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown,

	Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse

<SPEECH 54><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<76%>
	I have no moe sons of the royal blood
	For thee to slaughter: for my daughters, Richard,

	And therefore level not to hit their lives.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<76%>
	And must she die for this? O! let her live,
	And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
	Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
	Throw over her the veil of infamy:
	So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
	I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 4><SCENE 4><76%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<77%>
	To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

	True, when avoided grace makes destiny.

<SPEECH 60><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<77%>
	Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd

	Whose hands soever lanc'd their tender hearts
	Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
	No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
	Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
	Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
	And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
	Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
	Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<77%>
	Flatter my sorrow with report of it:

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 4><SCENE 4><77%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<78%>
	Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness

<SPEECH 65><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 4><78%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<78%>
	Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
	A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave

	Therefore present to her, as sometime Margaret
	Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,
	A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain
	The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
	And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
	If this inducement move her not to love,
	Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
	Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
	Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake,
	Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
</Q. ELIZABETH>

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>

</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 78><ACT 4><SCENE 4><80%>

	God's wrong is most of all.
	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,

	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,
	The imperial metal, circling now thy head,
	Had grac'd the tender temples of my child,
	And both the princes had been breathing here,
	Which now, too tender bed-fellows for dust,
	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
	What canst thou swear by now?
</Q. ELIZABETH>

<SPEECH 92><ACT 4><SCENE 4><81%>
<Q. ELIZABETH>	<81%>
	That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
	For I myself have many tears to wash
	Hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee.
	The children live, whose parents thou hast slaughter'd,
	Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age:
	The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
	Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
