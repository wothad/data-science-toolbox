<YORK>	<38%>
	Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<YORK>	<38%>
	Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
	My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
	More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester,
	'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<YORK>	<39%>
	Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
	I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
	To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<YORK>	<39%>
	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast,
	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old:
	'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<YORK>	<39%>
	Grandam, his nurse.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 2><SCENE 4><38%>
<YORK>	<39%>
	If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 8><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:
	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 9><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	And therefore is he idle?
</YORK>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	Then he is more beholding to you than I.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
	And, being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	O, then, I see, you'll part but with light gifts;
	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<43%>
	I would, that I might thank you, as you call me.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<44%>
	Little.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><43%>
<YORK>	<44%>
	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.
	Because that I am little, like an ape,
	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<YORK>	<44%>
	What! will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
</YORK>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<YORK>	<44%>
	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
</YORK>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<YORK>	<44%>
	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
	My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
