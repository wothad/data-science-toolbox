<BUCKINGHAM>	<12%>
	Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 2><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<13%>
	Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks cheerfully.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 3><ACT 1><SCENE 3><12%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<13%>
	Ay, madam: he desires to make atonement
	Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
	And between them and my lord chamberlain;
	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 4><ACT 1><SCENE 3><16%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<17%>
	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 5><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<19%>
	Peace, peace! for shame, if not for charity.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 6><ACT 1><SCENE 3><18%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<19%>
	Have done, have done.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 7><ACT 1><SCENE 3><19%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<19%>
	Nor no one here; for curses never pass

	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

<BUCKINGHAM>	<29%>
<STAGE DIR>
<To the Queen.>
</STAGE DIR> Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
	Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
	Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
	With hate in those where I expect most love!
	When I have most need to employ a friend,
	And most assured that he is a friend,
	Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
	Be he unto me! This do I beg of God,
	When I am cold in love to you or yours.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 10><ACT 2><SCENE 1><29%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<30%>
	And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 11><ACT 2><SCENE 1><30%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<31%>
	Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 12><ACT 2><SCENE 1><32%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<32%>
	We wait upon your Grace.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 13><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<35%>
	You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
	That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
	Now cheer each other in each other's love:
	Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
	We are to reap the harvest of his son.
	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
	But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
	Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept:
	Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
	Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
	Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 14><ACT 2><SCENE 2><35%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<36%>
	Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
	The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out;
	Which would be so much the more dangerous,
	By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
	Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
	And may direct his course as please himself,
	As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
	In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 15><ACT 2><SCENE 2><36%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<36%>
	My lord, whoever journeys to the prince,
	For God's sake, let not us two stay at home:
	For by the way I'll sort occasion,
	As index to the story we late talk'd of,
	To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 16><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<40%>
	Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 17><ACT 3><SCENE 1><40%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	And in good time here comes the sweating lord.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 18><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	Fie! what an indirect and peevish course
	Is this of hers! Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
	Unto his princely brother presently?
	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 19><ACT 3><SCENE 1><41%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<41%>
	You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
	Too ceremonious and traditional:
	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
	The benefit thereof is always granted
	To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
	And those who have the wit to claim the place:
	This prince hath neither claim'd it, nor deserv'd it;
	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
	You break no privilege nor charter there.
	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,
	But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 20><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<42%>
	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 21><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<42%>
	Upon record, my gracious lord.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 22><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<43%>
	What, my gracious lord?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 23><ACT 3><SCENE 1><42%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<43%>
	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 24><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	With what a sharp provided with he reasons!
	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
	So cunning and so young is wonderful.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 25><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	Think you, my lord, this little prating York
	Was not incensed by his subtle mother
	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 26><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<44%>
	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby; thou art sworn
	As deeply to effect what we intend
	As closely to conceal what we impart.
	Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way:
	What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
	For the instalment of this noble duke
	In the seat royal of this famous isle?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 27><ACT 3><SCENE 1><44%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	What think'st thou then of Stanley? what will he?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 28><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
	And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings,
	How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
	To sit about the coronation.
	If thou dost find him tractable to us,
	Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons:
	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
	Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
	And give us notice of his inclination;
	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 29><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 30><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive
	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 31><ACT 3><SCENE 1><45%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<45%>
	I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 32><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<49%>
	What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
	Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
	Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 33><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<49%>
	I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay:
	I shall return before your lordship thence.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 34><ACT 3><SCENE 2><49%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<49%>
<STAGE DIR>
<Aside.>
</STAGE DIR> And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
	Come, will you go?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 35><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<50%>
	Are all things ready for that royal time?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 36><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<50%>
	Who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein?
	Who is most inward with the noble duke?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 37><ACT 3><SCENE 4><50%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<50%>
	We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
	He knows no more of mine than I of yours;
	Nor I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
	Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 38><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<51%>
	Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
	William Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part,
	I mean, your voice, for crowning of the king.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 39><ACT 3><SCENE 4><51%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<51%>
	Withdraw yourself a while; I'll go with you.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 40><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<53%>
	Tut! I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,
	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
	Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
	And both are ready in their offices,
	At any time, to grace my stratagems.
	But what! is Catesby gone?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 41><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<53%>
	Lord Mayor,—
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 42><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<53%>
	Hark! a drum.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 43><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<53%>
	Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent,—
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 44><ACT 3><SCENE 5><53%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<53%>
	God and our innocency defend and guard us!

</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 45><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<54%>
	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
	That ever liv'd.
	Would you imagine, or almost believe,—
	Were't not that by great preservation
	We live to tell it, that the subtle traitor
	This day had plotted, in the council-house,
	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 46><ACT 3><SCENE 5><54%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<54%>
	Yet had we not determin'd he should die,
	Until your lordship came to see his end;
	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
	Something against our meaning, hath prevented:
	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
	That you might well have signified the same
	Unto the citizens, who haply may
	Misconster us in him, and wail his death.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 47><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<55%>
	But since you come too late of our intent,
	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
	And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 48><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<55%>
	Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
	As if the golden fee for which I plead
	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 49><ACT 3><SCENE 5><55%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<56%>
	I go; and towards three or four o'clock
	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 50><ACT 3><SCENE 7><56%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<56%>
	Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
	The citizens are mum, say not a word.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 51><ACT 3><SCENE 7><56%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<56%>
	I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
	And his contract by deputy in France;
	The insatiate greediness of his desires,
	And his enforcement of the city wives;
	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
	As being got, your father then in France,
	And his resemblance, being not like the duke:
	Withal I did infer your lineaments,
	Being the right idea of your father,
	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
	Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
	Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
	Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse;
	And when my oratory drew toward end,
	I bade them that did love their country's good
	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 52><ACT 3><SCENE 7><57%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<57%>
	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
	But, like dumb statuas or breathing stones,
	Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
	And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
	His answer was, the people were not wont
	To be spoke to but by the recorder.
	Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again:
	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
	But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
	At lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
	And some ten voices cried, 'God save King Richard!'
	And thus I took the vantage of those few,
	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
	'This general applause and cheerful shout
	Argues your wisdom and your love to Richard:'
	And even here brake off, and came away.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 53><ACT 3><SCENE 7><57%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<57%>
	The mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
	Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit:
	And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
	And stand between two churchmen, good my lord:
	For on that ground I'll make a holy descant:
	And be not easily won to our requests;
	Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 54><ACT 3><SCENE 7><57%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<58%>
	Go, go, up to the leads! the Lord Mayor knocks.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Gloucester.>
</STAGE DIR>

<STAGE DIR>
<Enter the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens.>
</STAGE DIR>
	Welcome, my lord: I dance attendance here;
	I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 55><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<58%>
	Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke:
	Tell him, myself, the mayor and aldermen,
	In deep designs in matter of great moment,
	No less importing than our general good,
	Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 56><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<58%>
	Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
	He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
	But on his knees at meditation;
	Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
	But meditating with two deep divines;
	Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
	But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
	Happy were England, would this virtuous prince
	Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof:
	But sore, I fear, we shall not win him to it.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 57><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<58%>
	I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.

</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 58><ACT 3><SCENE 7><58%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Sorry I am my noble cousin should
	Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
	By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
	And so once more return, and tell his Grace.
<STAGE DIR>
<Exit Catesby.>
</STAGE DIR>
	When holy and devout religious men
	Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence;
	So sweet is zealous contemplation.

</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 59><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
	To stay him from the fall of vanity;
	And, see, a book of prayer in his hand;
	True ornament to know a holy man.
	Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
	Lend favourable ear to our requests,
	And pardon us the interruption
	Of thy devotion, and right Christian zeal.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 60><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
	And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 61><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	You have, my lord: would it might please your Grace,
	On our entreaties to amend your fault!
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 62><ACT 3><SCENE 7><59%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<59%>
	Know then, it is your fault that you resign
	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
	The sceptred office of your ancestors,
	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
	The lineal glory of your royal house,
	To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
	Whiles, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,—
	Which here we waken to our country's good,—
	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
	Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
	And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
	Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
	Which to recure we heartily solicit
	Your gracious self to take on you the charge
	And kingly government of this your land;
	Not as protector, steward, substitute,
	Or lowly factor for another's gain;
	But as successively from blood to blood,
	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
	For this, consorted with the citizens,
	Your very worshipful and loving friends,
	And by their vehement instigation,
	In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 63><ACT 3><SCENE 7><60%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<61%>
	My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace;
	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
	All circumstances well considered.
	You say that Edward is your brother's son:
	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
	For first was he contract to Lady Lucy,
	Your mother lives a witness to his vow,
	And afterward by substitute betroth'd
	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
	These both put by, a poor petitioner,
	A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
	Even in the afternoon of her best days,
	Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
	Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
	To base declension and loath'd bigamy:
	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
	This Edward, whom our manners call the prince.
	More bitterly could I expostulate,
	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
	This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
	If not to bless us and the land withal,
	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
	From the corruption of abusing times,
	Unto a lineal true-derived course.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 64><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<61%>
	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 65><ACT 3><SCENE 7><61%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<62%>
	If you refuse it, as, in love and zeal,
	Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
	As well we know your tenderness of heart
	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
	Which we have noted in you to your kindred,
	And egally, indeed, to all estates,
	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
	But we will plant some other in the throne,
	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
	And in this resolution here we leave you.
	Come, citizens, we will entreat no more.
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 66><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<62%>
	Then I salute you with this royal title:
	Long live King Richard, England's worthy king!
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 67><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<62%>
	To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 68><ACT 3><SCENE 7><62%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<62%>
	To-morrow then we will attend your Grace:
	And so most joyfully we take our leave.

<SPEECH 71><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>

	Say on, my loving lord.

<SPEECH 72><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>

<SPEECH 75><ACT 4><SCENE 2><66%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<66%>
	Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,

<SPEECH 76><ACT 4><SCENE 2><68%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<68%>

	Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

<SPEECH 89><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<86%>
	Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey and Rivers,
	Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
	Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
	By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
	If that your moody discontented souls
	Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
	Even for revenge mock my destruction!
	This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
</BUCKINGHAM>

<SPEECH 90><ACT 5><SCENE 1><87%>
<BUCKINGHAM>	<87%>
	Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
	This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
	I wish'd might fall on me, when I was found
	False to his children or his wife's allies;
	This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
	By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
	This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
	Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs.
	That high All-Seer which I dallied with
	Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head,
	And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
	Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
	To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
	Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck:
	'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
	Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
	Come, lead me, officers, to the block of shame:
	Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
